The outbreak left about 17,000 survivors of the disease, many of whom report post-recovery symptoms termed [[post-Ebola syndrome]], often severe enough to require medical care for months or even years.

== Overview ==

Ebola virus disease (commonly known as "Ebola")  was first described in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and what is now [[South Sudan]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 2395567 | pmid=307456 | volume=56 | issue=2 | title=Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Zaire, 1976 | year=1978 | journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization | pages=271–293}}</ref> The 2013–2016 outbreak, caused by Ebola virus (EBOV),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Becker |first1=Stephan |last2=Matrosovich |first2=Mikhail |last3=Krähling |first3=Verena |last4=Schudt |first4=Gordian |last5=Dietzel |first5=Erik |title=Functional Characterization of Adaptive Mutations during the West African Ebola Virus Outbreak |journal=Journal of Virology |date=15 January 2017 |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=e01913–e01916 |doi=10.1128/JVI.01913-16 |pmid=27847361 |pmc=5215343 }}</ref> was the first anywhere in the world to reach epidemic proportions. Previous outbreaks had been brought under control in a much shorter period of time. [[Extreme poverty]], dysfunctional healthcare systems, distrust of government after years of armed conflict, and the delay in responding for several months, all contributed to the failure to control the epidemic. Other factors, per media reports, included local burial customs of washing the body and the unprecedented spread of Ebola to densely populated cities.<ref name=sitrep_24Sept2014>{{cite report|title=Ebola response roadmap situation report |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/134771/1/roadmapsitrep_24Sept2014_eng.pdf?ua=1 |format=PDF |publisher=WHO|access-date=25 September 2014|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Runaway doctors and missing supplies cripple care in Ebola-hit Liberia |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/runaway-doctors-missing-supplies-cripple-care-ebola-hit-liberia-n220686 |work=NBC News|access-date=8 October 2014}}</ref><ref name="WHO 2014-07-03">{{cite report|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4216-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-3-july-2014.html|title=Ebola virus disease, West Africa|date=3 July 2014|publisher=WHO|access-date=18 September 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728210024/http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4216-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-3-july-2014.html|archive-date=28 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Global Post">{{cite news |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/xinhua-news-agency/140527/8-ebola-suspects-freed-relatives-sierra-leone |title=8 Ebola suspects freed by relatives in Sierra Leone |publisher=Global Post |agency=Xinhua |date=28 May 2014 |access-date=21 June 2014 |archive-date=31 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531084044/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/xinhua-news-agency/140527/8-ebola-suspects-freed-relatives-sierra-leone |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Today Health">{{cite news |url=http://www.today.com/health/growing-ebola-outbreak-threatens-overwhelm-volunteers-2D79775266 |title=Growing Ebola outbreak threatens to overwhelm volunteers |publisher=Today Health |date=8 June 2014 |access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref>

Since the discovery of the viruses in 1976, when outbreaks occurred in South Sudan (then Sudan) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Zaire), Ebola virus disease had been confined to areas in Middle Africa, where it is native. With the current outbreak, it was initially thought that a new species native to Guinea might be the cause, rather than being imported from Middle to Western Africa.<ref name="Baize-2014" /> However, further studies have shown that the outbreak was likely caused by an Ebola virus lineage that spread from Middle Africa via an animal host within the last decade, with the first viral transfer to humans in Guinea.<ref name="Gire 2014" /><ref name="EurekAlert!">{{cite journal|last1=Schoepp|first1=Randal J.|last2=Rossi|first2=Cynthia A.|last3=Khan|first3=Sheik H.|last4=Goba|first4=Augustine|last5=Fair|first5=Joseph N.|title=Undiagnosed Acute Viral Febrile Illnesses, Sierra Leone|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=20|issue=7|pages=1176–1182|doi=10.3201/eid2007.131265|pmid=24959946|pmc=4073864|year=2014}}</ref>

In a study done by [[Tulane University]], the [[Broad Institute]] and [[Harvard University]], in partnership with the [[Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation]], researchers provided information about the origin and transmission of the Ebola virus that set the Western African outbreak apart from previous ones, including 341 genetic changes in the [[virion]].<ref name="Gire 2014" /> Five members of the research team became ill and died from Ebola before the study was published in August 2014.<ref name="Gire 2014" />

In a report released in August 2014,  researchers tracked the spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone from the group first infected—13 women who had attended the funeral of the traditional healer, where they contracted the disease—giving them a unique opportunity to track how the virus had changed.  This provided "the first time that the real evolution of the Ebola virus [could] be observed in humans." The research showed that the outbreak in Sierra Leone was sparked by at least two distinct lineages introduced from Guinea at about the same time. It is not clear whether the traditional healer was infected with both variants, or if perhaps one of the women attending the funeral was independently infected. As the Sierra Leone epidemic progressed, one virus lineage disappeared from patient samples, while a third one appeared.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Genomes reveal start of Ebola outbreak | journal=Science | volume=345 | issue=6200 | pages=989–990 | date=29 August 2014 | last1=Vogel|first1= Gretchen| bibcode=2014Sci...345..989V | pmid=25170128 | doi=10.1126/science.345.6200.989 | doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite report|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/phe-study-finds-ebola-virus-mutated-slower-than-first-thought|title=PHE study finds Ebola virus mutated slower than first thought|author=Public Health England|publisher=Public Health England|access-date=15 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dddmag.com/news/2015/06/scientists-release-ebola-sequencing-data-global-research-community-online|title=Scientists Release Ebola Sequencing Data to Global Research Community Online|publisher=Drug Discovery & Development|access-date=7 June 2015|date=2015-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Simon-Loriere|first1=Etienne|last2=Faye|first2=Ousmane|last3=Faye|first3=Oumar|last4=Koivogui|first4=Lamine|last5=Magassouba|first5=Nfaly|last6=Keita|first6=Sakoba|last7=Thiberge|first7=Jean-Michel|last8=Diancourt|first8=Laure|last9=Bouchier|first9=Christiane|last10=Vandenbogaert|first10=Matthias|last11=Caro|first11=Valérie|last12=Fall|first12=Gamou|last13=Buchmann|first13=Jan P.|last14=Matranga|first14=Christan B.|last15=Sabeti|first15=Pardis C.|last16=Manuguerra|first16=Jean-Claude|last17=Holmes|first17=Edward C.|last18=Sall|first18=Amadou A.|title=Distinct lineages of Ebola virus in Guinea during the 2014 West African epidemic|journal=Nature|date=6 August 2015|volume=524|issue=7563|pages=102–104|doi=10.1038/nature14612|pmid=26106863|bibcode=2015Natur.524..102S|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In January 2015, the media stated researchers in Guinea had reported mutations in the virus samples that they were looking at.  According to them, "we've now seen several cases that don't have any symptoms at all, asymptomatic cases.

[[File:EbolaCycle.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The life cycles of the Ebolavirus]]
The initial infection is believed to occur after an Ebola virus is transmitted to a human by contact with an infected animal's body fluids.

Prior to this outbreak, it was believed that human-to-human transmission occurred only via direct contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected person who is showing symptoms of infection, by contact with the body of a person who had died of Ebola, or by contact with objects recently contaminated with the body fluids of an actively ill infected person.<ref name=CDCPress2014>{{cite report|title=CDC Telebriefing on Ebola outbreak in West Africa|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/t0728-ebola.html|publisher=CDC|access-date=3 August 2014|date=28 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=Ost2015>{{cite journal|last1=Osterholm|first1=MT|last2=Moore|first2=KA|last3=Kelley|first3=NS|last4=Brosseau|first4=LM|last5=Wong|first5=G|last6=Murphy|first6=FA|last7=Peters|first7=CJ|last8=LeDuc|first8=JW|last9=Russell|first9=PK|last10=Van Herp|first10=M|last11=Kapetshi|first11=J|last12=Muyembe|first12=JJ|last13=Ilunga|first13=BK|last14=Strong|first14=JE|last15=Grolla|first15=A|last16=Wolz|first16=A|last17=Kargbo|first17=B|last18=Kargbo|first18=DK|last19=Formenty|first19=P|last20=Sanders|first20=DA|author21-link=Gary Kobinger|last21=Kobinger|first21=GP|title=Transmission of Ebola viruses: what we know and what we do not know|journal=mBio|date=19 February 2015|volume=6|issue=2|page=e00137|pmid=25698835|doi=10.1128/mBio.00137-15|pmc=4358015}}</ref>
It is now known that the Ebola virus can be transmitted sexually.

The WHO based their new recommendations on a March 2015 case, in which a Liberian woman who had no contact with the disease other than having had unprotected sex with a man who had had the disease in October 2014, was diagnosed with Ebola. While no evidence of the virus was found in his blood, his semen revealed Ebola virus RNA closely matching the variant that infected the woman. However, "doctors don't know if there was any fully formed (and therefore infectious) virus in the guy's semen."  It is known that testes are protected from the body's immune system to protect the developing [[sperm]], and it is thought that this same protection may allow the virus to survive in the testes for an unknown time.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.popsci.com/why-ebola-lives-so-long-survivors-testicles|title=Why Testicles Are The Perfect Hiding Spot For Ebola|magazine=Popular Science|access-date=7 May 2015}}</ref>

One of the primary reasons for the spread of the disease is the low-quality, functioning health systems in the parts of Africa where the disease occurs.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Tiaji|last1=Salaam-Blyther|title=The 2014 Ebola Outbreak: International and U.S. Responses|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43697.pdf|access-date=9 September 2014|date=26 August 2014}}</ref> The risk of transmission is increased among those caring for people infected.

In August 2014, the WHO published a road map of the steps required to bring the epidemic under control and to prevent further transmission of the disease within Western Africa; the coordinated [[Responses to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa#WHO|international response]] worked towards realising this plan.<ref name="res">{{cite report|title=Ebola response Roadmap|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/131596/1/EbolaResponseRoadmap.pdf| publisher=WHO|access-date=21 June 2016}}</ref>

=== Surveillance and contact tracing ===
[[Contact tracing]] is an essential method of preventing the spread of the disease, this requires effective [[Epidemiological surveillance|community surveillance]] so that a possible case of Ebola can be registered and accurately diagnosed as soon as possible, and subsequently finding everyone who has had close contact with the case and tracking them for 21 days. However, this requires careful record-keeping by properly trained and equipped staff.<ref>{{cite report |title=Contact tracing |url=https://www.who.int/features/qa/contact-tracing/en/ |publisher=WHO |access-date=27 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The reason Ebola isn't being stopped|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/11/health/ebola-contact-tracing/|publisher=CNN|access-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> WHO Assistant Director-General for Global Health Security, Keiji Fukuda, said on 3 September 2014, "We don't have enough health workers, doctors, nurses, drivers, and contact tracers to handle the increasing number of cases."<ref name="WHO 2014-9-3 Ebola response needs">{{cite report|title=UN senior leaders outline needs for global Ebola response|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/ebola-response-needs/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907161412/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/ebola-response-needs/en/|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 September 2014|publisher=WHO|access-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> There was a massive effort to train volunteers and health workers, sponsored by [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID).<ref>{{cite report|title=Fact sheet: U.S. Response to the Ebola Epidemic in West Africa|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/16/fact-sheet-us-response-ebola-epidemic-west-africa|via=[[NARA|National Archives]]|work=[[whitehouse.gov]]|access-date=2 November 2014}}</ref> According to WHO reports, 25,926 contacts from Guinea, 35,183 from Liberia and 104,454 from Sierra Leone were listed and traced as of 23 November 2014.<ref name=WHO2014_11_23 /> According to one study, it is important to have a public awareness campaign to inform the affected community about the importance of contact tracing, so that true information can be obtained from the community.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Learning from the challenges of Ebola Virus Disease contact tracers in Sierra Leone, February, 2015|pmc=4695526|pmid=26740849|doi=10.11694/pamj.supp.2015.22.1.6537|volume=22|issue=Suppl 1|year=2015|page=21| last1 = Ilesanmi | first1 = OS | journal=Pan Afr Med J|doi-broken-date=28 February 2022}}</ref>

During the height of the epidemic, most schools in the three most affected countries were shut down and remained closed for several months. During the period of closure [[UNICEF]] and its partners established strict hygiene protocols to be used when the schools were reopened in January 2015.  They met with thousands of teachers and administrators to work out hygiene guidelines.  Their efforts included installing hand-washing stations and distributing millions of bars of soap and chlorine and plans for taking the temperature of children and staff at the school gate.  Their efforts were complicated by the fact that less than 50% of the schools in these three countries had access to running water. In August 2015, UNICEF released a report that stated, "Across the three countries, there have been no reported cases of a student or teacher being infected at a school since strict hygiene protocols were introduced when classes resumed at the beginning of the year after a months-long delay caused by the virus."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_82875.html|title=Hygiene practices have helped keep Ebola out of the classroom|date=12 August 2015|publisher=UNICEF|access-date=14 August 2015|archive-date=15 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815092946/http://www.unicef.org/media/media_82875.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Researchers presented evidence indicating that infected people that lived in low socioeconomic areas were more likely to transmit the virus to other socioeconomic status (SES) communities, in contrast to individuals in higher SES areas who were infected as well.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mosoka P.

=== Travel restrictions and quarantines ===

There was serious concern that the disease would spread further within Western Africa or elsewhere in the world, such as:
* '''Western Africa''' On 8 August 2014, a ''[[Cordon sanitaire (medicine)|cordon sanitaire]]'', a disease-fighting practice that forcibly isolates affected regions, was established in the triangular area where Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are separated only by porous borders and where 70 per cent of the known cases had been found.<ref name=cordon>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/science/using-a-tactic-unseen-in-a-century-countries-cordon-off-ebola-racked-areas.html |last=McNeil |first=Donald G., Jr. |title=Using a Tactic Unseen in a Century, Countries Cordon Off Ebola-Racked Areas |newspaper=The New York Times |date=13 August 2014 |access-date=14 August 2014}}</ref> This was subsequently replaced by a series of simple checkpoints for hand-washing and measuring body temperature on major roads throughout the region, manned either by local volunteers or by the military.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Sierra Leone's Ebola hot zone: A series of reports|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/100706/in-sierra-leone-s-ebola-hot-zone-a-series-of-reports|publisher=UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|access-date=2 November 2014|date=2014-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rally around West African communities to fight Ebola|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/opinion/2024924352_maxweihecolumnebola02xml.html|newspaper=The Seattle Times|access-date=2 November 2014}}</ref>
* '''International''' Many countries considered imposing travel restrictions to or from the region. On 2 September 2014, WHO Director-General [[Margaret Chan]] advised against this, saying that they were not justified and that they would prevent medical experts from entering the affected areas. She also stated that they were "marginalizing the affected population and potentially worsening the crisis". UN officials working on the ground also criticised the travel restrictions, saying the solution was "not in travel restrictions but in ensuring that effective preventive and curative health measures are put in place".<ref name="As Ebola Outbreak Surges, Health Officials Slam International 'Coalition of Inaction'">{{cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2014/09/03/ebola-outbreak-surges-health-officials-slam-international-coalition-inaction |title=As Ebola Outbreak Surges, Health Officials Slam International 'Coalition of Inaction' |publisher=Common Dreams |date=3 September 2014 |access-date=7 September 2014 |author=McCauley, Lauren}}</ref> MSF also spoke out against the closure of international borders, calling them "another layer of collective irresponsibility" and added: "The international community must ensure that those who try to contain the outbreak can enter and leave the affected countries if need be."<ref name="Ebola: the failures of the international outbreak response" />

:In December 2015, during the 8th meeting of WHO's "[[International Health Regulations|IHR]] Emergency Committee regarding Ebola", it spoke out against further travel restrictions saying: "The Committee remains deeply concerned that 34 countries still enact inappropriate travel and transport measures and highlights the need to immediately terminate any such measures due to their negative impact, particularly on recovery efforts."<ref>{{cite report|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2015/ihr-ebola-8th-meeting/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222223327/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2015/ihr-ebola-8th-meeting/en/|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 December 2015|title=Statement on the 8th meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee regarding the Ebola outbreak in West Africa|publisher=WHO |access-date=9 June 2016}}</ref> In December 2015, the CDC indicated that it would no longer make the recommendation for US citizens going to Sierra Leone to be extra careful.

Without fluid replacement, such an extreme loss of fluids leads to [[dehydration]], which in turn may lead to [[hypovolaemic shock]]—a condition in which there isn't enough blood for the heart to pump through the body.

Treatment centres were overflowing with patients while others waited to be admitted; dead patients were so numerous that it was difficult to arrange for safe burials.  Based on many years of experience in Africa—and several months working in the present epidemic—MSF took a conservative approach.  While using IV treatment for as many patients as they could manage, they argued that improperly managed IV treatment was not helpful and may even kill a patient when not properly managed. They also said that they were concerned about further risk to already overworked staff.<ref name=NYT010115 />  In 2015 experts  studied the mortality rates of different treatment settings, and given the wide differences in variables that affected outcomes, adequate information had not yet been gathered to make a definitive statement about what constituted optimal care in the Western African setting.<ref name="GHD online">{{cite news| url=http://www.ghdonline.org/ebola/discussion/iv-therapy-for-ebola/ | title=IV Therapy for Ebola | publisher=Communities/Ebola Response | date=January 2015 | access-date=7 January 2015}}</ref> [[Paul Farmer]] of [[Partners in Health]], an NGO that only as of January 2015 had begun to treat Ebola patients, strongly supported IV therapy for all Ebola patients stating: "What if the fatality rate isn't the virulence of disease but the mediocrity of the medical delivery?"

The disease affects males and females equally and the majority of those that contract Ebola disease are between 15 and 45 years of age.<ref name=":1" /> For those over 45 years, a fatal outcome was more likely in the Western African epidemic, as was also noted in preceding outbreaks.<ref name=":7" />

It has been suggested that the loss of human life was not limited to Ebola victims alone.  Many hospitals had to shut down, leaving people with other medical needs without care. A spokesperson for the UK-based health foundation, the [[Wellcome Trust]], said in October 2014 that "the additional death toll from malaria and other diseases [is] likely to exceed that of the outbreak itself".<ref name=":2" /> Dr Paul Farmer stated: "Most of Ebola's victims may well be dying from other causes: women in childbirth, children from diarrhoea, people in road accidents or from trauma of other sorts."<ref name="Diary" />
As the epidemic drew to a close in 2015, a report from Sierra Leone showed that the fear and mistrust of hospitals generated by the epidemic had resulted in an 11% decline in facility-based births, and that those receiving care before or after birth fell by about a fifth.  Consequently, between May 2014 and April 2015, the deaths of women during or just after childbirth rose by almost a third and those of newborns by a quarter, compared to the previous year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/07/baby-and-maternal-deaths-soar-in-sierra-leone-amid-ebola-fears-researchers|title=Baby and maternal deaths soar in Sierra Leone amid Ebola fears – researchers|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=8 October 2015|date=2015-10-07}}</ref>

Research suggests that many Ebola infections are asymptomatic, meaning that some infected people show no symptoms of the disease. For example, two studies done on previous outbreaks showed that 71% of [[seropositive]] individuals did not have the clinical disease in one outbreak and another study reported that 46% of asymptomatic close contacts of patients with Ebola were seropositive.<ref name="The Lancet">{{cite journal | url= | title=Ebola control: effect of asymptomatic infection and acquired immunity | journal=The Lancet | volume=384 | issue=9953 | pages=1499–1500 | date=15 October 2015 |author1=Steve E Bellanemail |author2=Juliet R C Pulliam |author3=Jonathan Dushoff |author4=Lauren Ancel Meyers | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61839-0| pmid=25390569 |pmc=4829342 }}</ref> On 22 January, the WHO issued ''Clinical Care for survivors of Ebola Virus Disease: interim guidance''. The guidance covers specific issues like musculoskeletal pain, which is reported in up to 75% of survivors. The pain is symmetrical and more pronounced in the morning, with the larger joints most affected. There is also possible periarticular [[tenosynovitis]] affecting the shoulders. The WHO guidelines advise to distinguish non-inflammatory [[arthralgia]] from inflammatory [[arthritis]]. With regard to ocular problems, sensitivity to light and blurry vision have been indicated among survivors. Among the aftereffects of Ebola virus disease, uveitis and optic nerve disease could appear after an individual is discharged. Ocular problems could threaten sight in survivors, thus the need for prompt treatment. In treating such individuals, the WHO recommends urgent intervention if uveitis is suspected; this consists mainly of prednisone (a [[corticosteroid]]). Hearing loss has been reported in Ebola survivors 25% of the time. Treatment, in the case of acute [[labyrinthitis]] (inner ear disorder), should be given within 10 days of the onset of symptoms and prochlorperazine, a vestibular sedative, may be administered for [[vertigo]].<ref>{{cite report|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/204235/1/WHO_EVD_OHE_PED_16.1_eng.pdf?ua=1 |format= PDF|title=Clinical care for survivors of Ebola virus disease|publisher=WHO |date=11 April 2016}}</ref>

The medical director of a hospital in Liberia reported that he was seeing health problems in patients who had been in recovery for as long as nine months. Problems he was seeing included chronic pain, sometimes so severe that walking was difficult; eye problems, including uveitis; and headaches as the most common physical symptoms. "They're still very severe and impacting their life every day. These patients will need medical care for months and maybe years."  A physician from the Kenema hospital in Sierra Leone reported similar health difficulties.<ref name="New York Times" />

In December 2014, a British aid worker who had just returned from Sierra Leone was diagnosed with Ebola.  She was treated with survivors' blood plasma and experimental drugs and declared free of disease in January 2015.  However, in October 2015, she again became critically ill and was diagnosed with meningitis.  In this unprecedented case it is thought that the virus remained in her brain replicating at a very low level until it had replicated to a degree capable of causing clinical meningitis. The woman was treated and in November 2015 it was reported that she had recovered.<ref name="auto8" /><ref name="davidwilcock" />

==== Ebola survivor studies ====

An observational study, done roughly 29 months after the 2007 [[Bundibugyo virus|Bundibugyo]] outbreak in [[Uganda]], found that long-term [[sequelae]] (i.e. consequences) persisted among survivors.  Symptoms included eye pain, blurred vision, hearing loss, difficulty swallowing, difficulty sleeping, arthralgias, memory loss or confusion, and "various constitutional symptoms controlling for age and sex".<ref name="The Lancet" />

From August through December 2014, a total of 10 patients with Ebola were treated in US hospitals; of these patients, 8 survived.  In March 2015, the CDC interviewed the survivors; they all reported having had at least one adverse symptom during their recovery period. The symptoms ranged from mild (e.g. hair loss) to more severe complications requiring re-hospitalisation or treatment. The most frequently reported symptoms were lethargy or fatigue, joint pain, and hair loss. Sixty-three per cent reported having eye problems including two who were diagnosed with uveitis, 75% reported psychological or cognitive symptoms, and 38% reported neural difficulties. Although most symptoms resolved or improved over time, only one survivor reported complete resolution of all symptoms.<ref name="New England Journal of Medicine">{{cite journal| title=Post-Ebola Signs and Symptoms in U.S. Survivors | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | date=17 December 2015 | doi=10.1056/NEJMc1506576 | pmid=26672870 | volume=373 | issue=25 | pages=2484–2486|last1 = Epstein|first1 = Lauren| last2=Wong | first2=Karen K | last3=Kallen | first3=Alexander J | last4=Uyeki | first4=Timothy M | doi-access=free }}</ref>

A study published in May 2015 discussed the case of Ian Crozier, a Zimbabwe-born physician and American citizen who became infected with Ebola while he was working at an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone. He was transported to the US and successfully treated at Emory University Hospital. However, after discharge Crozier began to experience symptoms including low back pain, bilateral [[enthesitis]] of the [[Achilles tendon]], [[paresthesias]] involving his lower legs, and eye pain, which was diagnosed as uveitis.  His eye condition worsened and a specimen of [[aqueous humor]] obtained from his eye tested positive for Ebola.  The authors of the study concluded that "further studies to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the ocular persistence of Ebola and the possible presence of the virus in other [[immune-privileged]] sites (e.g., in the [[central nervous system]], [[gonads]], and [[articular cartilage]]) are warranted."  The authors also noted that 40% of participants in a survey of 85 Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone reported having "eye problems", though the incidence of actual uveitis was unknown.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Persistence of Ebola Virus in Ocular Fluid during Convalescence |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1500306|volume=372|issue = 25|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|pages=2423–2427|pmid=25950269|date=Jun 2015|pmc=4547451 | last1 = Varkey | first1 = JB | last2 = Shantha | first2 = JG | last3 = Crozier | first3 = I | last4 = Kraft | first4 = CS | last5 = Lyon | first5 = GM | last6 = Mehta | first6 = AK | last7 = Kumar | first7 = G | last8 = Smith | first8 = JR | last9 = Kainulainen | first9 = MH | last10 = Whitmer | first10 = S | last11 = Ströher | first11 = U | last12 = Uyeki | first12 = TM | last13 = Ribner | first13 = BS | last14 = Yeh | first14 = S|hdl=2328/35704}}</ref>

Another study, which was released in August 2015 looked at the health difficulties reported by survivors.  Calling the set of symptoms "post-Ebolavirus disease syndrome", the research found symptoms that included "chronic joint and muscle pain, fatigue, anorexia, hearing loss, blurred vision, headache, sleep disturbances, low mood and short-term memory problems", and suggested the "implementation of specialised health services to treat and follow-up survivors".<ref name="Carod-Artal"/>

In late August, MSF called the situation "chaotic" and the medical response "inadequate." They reported that they had expanded their operations, but couldn't keep up with the rapidly increasing need for assistance, which had forced them to reduce the level of care: "It is not currently possible, for example, to administer intravenous treatments." Calling the situation "an emergency within the emergency", MSF reported that many hospitals had shut down due to lack of staff or fears of the virus among patients and staff, which had left people with other health problems without any care at all. Speaking from a remote region, an MSF worker said that a shortage of protective equipment was making the medical management of the disease difficult and that they had limited capacity to safely bury bodies.<ref name="doctorswithoutborders.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/field-news/liberia-msfs-new-ebola-management-centers-already-overwhelmed|title=MSF's new Ebola management centers already overwhelmed|publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières|access-date= 11 April 2015}}</ref>

By September, treatment for Ebola patients had become unavailable in some areas. Speaking on 12 September, WHO Director-General, Margaret Chan, said: "In the three hardest hit countries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of new cases is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them in the Ebola-specific treatment centres.

In early December, the WHO reported that at a national level there were enough beds in treatment facilities to treat and isolate all reported Ebola cases, although their uneven distribution was resulting in serious shortfalls in some areas. Similarly, all affected countries had sufficient and widespread capacity to bury reported deaths; however, because not all deaths were reported, it was possible that the reverse could have been the case in some areas. WHO also reported that every district had access to a laboratory to confirm cases of Ebola within 24 hours of sample collection, and that all three countries had reported that more than 80% of registered contacts associated with known cases of Ebola virus disease were being traced, although contact tracing was still a challenge in areas of intense transmission and those with community resistance.<ref name=WHO2014_12_10 />

A number of [[Aspen Medical|Ebola Treatment Centres]] were set up in the area, supported by international aid organisations and staffed by a combination of local and international staff. Each treatment centre is divided into a number of distinct and rigorously separate areas. For patients, there is a [[triage]] area, and low- and high-risk care wards. For staff, there are areas for preparation and decontamination. An important part of each centre is an arrangement for safe burial or cremation of bodies, required to prevent further infection.<ref>{{cite news|title=An Ebola treatment center|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/an-ebola-treatment-center/1333/|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=1 October 2014|archive-date=27 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927151615/http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/an-ebola-treatment-center/1333/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|title=Guidance for Safe Handling of Human Remains of Ebola Patients in U.

Although the WHO does not advise caring for Ebola patients at home, in some cases it became a necessity when no hospital treatment beds were available. For those being treated at home, the WHO advised informing the local public health authority and acquiring appropriate training and equipment.<ref>{{cite report|url=https://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/faq-ebola/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420044345/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/faq-ebola/en/|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 April 2014|title=Frequently asked questions on Ebola virus disease|publisher=WHO|date=8 August 2014|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/25/health/ebola-fatu-family/|title=Woman saves three relatives from Ebola |publisher=CNN | date=26 September 2014 |access-date=14 October 2014}}</ref> UNICEF, USAID and [[Samaritan's Purse]] began to take measures to provide support for families that were forced to care for patients at home by supplying caregiver kits intended for interim home-based interventions.

==== Protective clothing ====
[[File:Donning PPE- Inspect PPE Prior to Donning CDC04.webm|thumb|Examining equipment]]
The Ebola epidemic caused an increasing demand for protective clothing. A full set of protective clothing includes a suit, goggles, a mask, socks and boots, and an apron. Boots and aprons can be disinfected and reused, but everything else must be destroyed after use. Health workers change garments frequently, discarding gear that has barely been used. This not only takes a great deal of time but also exposes them to the virus because, for those wearing protective clothing, one of the most dangerous moments for contracting Ebola is while suits are being removed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-29518703|title=How not to catch Ebola |work=BBC News | date=7 October 2014 |access-date=13 October 2014}}</ref>

The protective clothing sets that MSF uses cost about $75 apiece. Staff who have returned from deployments to Western Africa say the clothing is so heavy that it can be worn for only about 40 minutes at a stretch. A physician working in Sierra Leone has said: "After about 30 or 40 minutes, your goggles have fogged up; your socks are completely drenched in sweat. You're just walking in water in your boots. And at that point, you have to exit for your own safety&nbsp;... Here it takes 20–25 minutes to take off a protective suit and must be done with two trained supervisors who watch every step in a military manner to ensure no mistakes are made, because a slip up can easily occur and of course can be fatal."<ref name="www.telegraph.co.uk Ebola-medics-better-trained-in-Sierra-Leone-than-Spain"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/07/354230895/ebola-protective-suits-are-in-short-supply|title=Ebola Protective Suits Are In Short Supply |newspaper=NPR.org |publisher=NPR | date=7 October 2014 |access-date=13 October 2014}}</ref>  By October, there were reports that protective outfits were beginning to be in short supply and manufacturers began to increase their production,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/ebola-enterovirus-flu-fuel-demand-protective-gear/story?id=26070092|title=Ebola Suit Maker Triples Output |publisher=ABC-News | date=9 October 2014 |access-date=13 October 2014}}</ref> but the need to find better types of suits has also been raised.<ref>{{cite news|last1=K|first1=Jayalakshmi|title=Ebola: Usaid Offers More Than Half a Million Pounds for Best Design for Protective Suit|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ebola-usaid-offers-more-half-million-pounds-best-design-protective-suit-1469594|access-date=28 October 2016|publisher=International Business Times UK|date=12 October 2014}}</ref>

On 17 December 2014, a team at [[Johns Hopkins University]] developed a prototype breakaway hazmat suit, and was awarded a grant from the USAID to develop it. The prototype has a small, battery-powered cooling pack on the worker's belt. "You'll have air blowing out that is room temperature but it's 0% humidity&nbsp;... the Ebola worker is going to feel cold and will be able to function inside the suit without having to change the suit so frequently", said one source.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/17/371413804/dreaming-up-a-safer-cooler-ppe-for-ebola-fighters |title=Dreaming Up A Safer, Cooler PPE For Ebola Fighters |date=17 December 2014 |publisher=NPR|access-date=18 December 2014}}</ref> In March, Google developed a tablet that could be cleaned with chlorine; it is charged wirelessly and can transmit information to servers outside the working area.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-31970731|title='Ebola-proof' tablet device developed|work=BBC News|access-date=21 March 2015|date=2015-03-20|last1=Mundasad|first1=Smitha}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/google-develops-ebolaproof-tablet-for-use-by-workers-in-sierra-leone/535450-11.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324141621/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/google-develops-ebolaproof-tablet-for-use-by-workers-in-sierra-leone/535450-11.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 March 2015|title=Google develops Ebola-proof tablet for use by workers in Sierra Leone|publisher=IBNLive|access-date=23 March 2015}}</ref>

The WHO recommends the use of 2 pairs of gloves, with the outer pair worn over the gown. Using 2 pairs may reduce the risk of sharp injuries; however, there is no evidence that using more than the recommended will give additional protection. WHO also recommends the use of a coverall, which is generally appraised in terms of its resistance to non-enveloped DNA virus. When a gown (or coverall) is worn, it should continue beyond the shoe covers.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=William A. Fischer II |author2=David J. Weber |author3=David A.

==== Healthcare workers ====

In the hardest hit areas there have historically been only one or two doctors available to treat 100,000&nbsp;people, and these doctors are heavily concentrated in urban areas.<ref name="WHO20140825" />  Ebola patients' healthcare providers, as well as family and friends, are at highest risk of getting infected because they are more likely to come in direct contact with their blood or body fluids. In some places affected by the outbreak, care may have been provided in clinics with limited resources, and workers could be in these areas for several hours with a number of Ebola infected patients.<ref name="CDC">{{cite report | url=https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/clinician-information-us-healthcare-settings.html | title=Ebola (Ebola Virus Disease) | publisher=CDC | access-date=28 October 2014}}</ref> According to the WHO, the high proportion of infected medical staff could be explained by a lack of adequate manpower to manage such a large outbreak, shortages of protective equipment or improper use of what was available, and "the compassion that causes medical staff to work in isolation wards far beyond the number of hours recommended as safe".<ref name="WHO20140825" />
In August 2014, healthcare workers represented nearly 10 per cent of cases and fatalities—significantly impairing the capacity to respond to an outbreak in an area already facing severe shortages.<ref>{{cite report |url=https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/2014/ebola-briefing/en/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814134528/http://www.who.int/dg/speeches/2014/ebola-briefing/en/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 August 2014 |title=WHO Director-General briefs Geneva UN missions on the Ebola outbreak |last=Chan |first=Margaret |publisher=WHO |date=12 August 2014 |access-date=14 August 2014}}</ref> By 1 July 2015, the WHO reported that a total of 874 health workers had been infected, of which 509 had died.<ref name="WHO2015_06_27">{{cite news|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/177990/1/roadmapsitrep_1Jul2015_eng.pdf?ua=1&ua=1|format= PDF|title=Ebola Situation Report|date=1 July 2015|access-date =4 July 2015}}</ref>

Basing their choice on "the person or persons who most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year", the editors of ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine in December 2014 named the Ebola health workers as [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]]. Editor Nancy Gibbs said: "The rest of the world can sleep at night because a group of men and women are willing to stand and fight.

The CDC report also stated that the Guinea Ministry of Health recorded males as representing 46% of the health workforce, and that 67% of Ebola infections among non-doctor healthcare workers occurred among males. The CDC further indicated that healthcare workers in Guinea were less likely to report contact with an infected individual than non-healthcare workers.<ref>{{cite report|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6438a6.htm|title=Ebola Virus Disease in Health Care Workers — Guinea, 2014|publisher=CDC|access-date=27 January 2016}}</ref>

The effectiveness of potential treatments for any disease is usually assessed in a [[randomised controlled trial]], which compares the outcome of those who received treatment to those who received a [[placebo]] (i.e. dummy treatment).  However, randomised controlled trials are considered unethical when a disease is frequently fatal, as is the case with Ebola. In December 2015, a study was released that found that the viral load found in a patient's blood in the week after the onset of symptoms is a strong indication of the patient's likelihood to die or survive the disease.

Of the nearly 6,000 people vaccinated, none had contracted Ebola after a ten-day period while in the group not vaccinated 23 cases developed.

The vaccine has not yet had regulatory approval, but it is considered to be so effective that 300,000 doses have already been stockpiled.  Researchers have found the results "quite encouraging [but] there is still a lot more work to be done on vaccines for Ebola."

Visual inspection of incidence curves alone could not render the needed results or data; growth rates with a two-dimensional heat map were used. Finally, the study showed that accurate predictions of growth were improbable, coupled with knowledge about the disease that was not fully adequate at the time (as there were now cases of sexual transmission).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Santermans|first1=Eva|last2=Robesyn|first2=Emmanuel|last3=Ganyani|first3=Tapiwa|last4=Sudre|first4=Bertrand|last5=Faes|first5=Christel|last6=Quinten|first6=Chantal|last7=Bortel|first7=Wim Van|last8=Haber|first8=Tom|last9=Kovac|first9=Thomas|last10=Reeth|first10=Frank Van|last11=Testa|first11=Marco|last12=Hens|first12=Niel|last13=Plachouras|first13=Diamantis|title=Spatiotemporal Evolution of Ebola Virus Disease at Sub-National Level during the 2014 West Africa Epidemic: Model Scrutiny and Data Meagreness|journal=PLOS ONE|date=15 January 2016|volume=11|issue=1|pages=e0147172|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0147172|issn=1932-6203|pmid=26771513|pmc=4714854|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1147172S|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Statistical measures ===
Calculating the ''[[case fatality rate]]'' (CFR) accurately is difficult in an ongoing epidemic due to differences in testing policies, the inclusion of probable and suspected cases, and the inclusion of new cases that have not run their course. In August 2014, the WHO made an initial CFR estimate of 53%, though this included suspected cases.<ref name=epi-fatal-rate>{{cite news|author=Rambaut, Andrew |title=Case Fatality Rate for ebolavirus |url=http://epidemic.bio.ed.ac.uk/ebolavirus_fatality_rate |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829075833/http://epidemic.bio.ed.ac.uk/ebolavirus_fatality_rate |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 August 2014 |date=7 August 2014 |publisher=Epidemic |access-date=16 September 2014 }}</ref><ref name="WHO_31Aug">{{cite report|url=http://who.int/csr/don/2014_09_04_ebola/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904215919/http://who.int/csr/don/2014_09_04_ebola/en/|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 September 2014|title=Ebola Response Roadmap Situation Report 2, 5 September 2014|publisher=WHO|access-date=18 September 2014}}</ref> In September and December 2014, the WHO released revised and more accurate CFR figures of 70.8% and 71% respectively, using data from patients with definitive clinical outcomes.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="cfrebolavirus" /><ref name=WHO2014_12_28 /> The CFR among hospitalised patients, based on the three intense-transmission countries, was between 57% and 59% in January 2015.<ref name="WHOreport" />

''Mortality'' is measured by number of deaths in a population per the proportion of the population per unit of time.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Porta|editor-first=M|title=A Dictionary of Epidemiology| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okf1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA69|year=2014|edition=5th|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford| isbn=978-0-19-939005-2|page=69|chapter=Death rate}}</ref>

The ''[[basic reproduction number]]'', ''R''<sub>0</sub>, is a statistical measure of the average number of people infected by a single infectious individual in a population with no prior immunity. If the basic reproduction number is less than 1, the epidemic will die out; if it is greater than 1, the epidemic will continues to spread—with exponential growth in the number of cases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Basic Reproductive Rate (Ro)|url=http://practice.sph.umich.edu/micphp/epicentral/basic_reproduc_rate.php|publisher=University of Michigan|access-date=16 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104222957/http://practice.sph.umich.edu/micphp/epicentral/basic_reproduc_rate.php|archive-date=4 November 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In September 2014, the estimated values of ''R''<sub>0</sub> were 1.71 (95%&nbsp;[[confidence interval|CI]], 1.44 to 2.01) for Guinea, 1.83 (95%&nbsp;CI, 1.72 to 1.94) for Liberia, and 2.02 (95%&nbsp;CI, 1.79 to 2.26) for Sierra Leone.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Althaus|first1=Christian L.|title=Estimating the Reproduction Number of Ebola Virus (EBOV) During the 2014 Outbreak in West Africa|journal=PLOS Currents|date=2014|doi=10.1371/currents.outbreaks.91afb5e0f279e7f29e7056095255b288|pmid=25642364|volume=6|pmc=4169395|bibcode=2014arXiv1408.3505A|arxiv=1408.3505}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=Allen G.|title=Exponential growth in Ebola outbreak since May 14, 2014|journal=Complexity|date=11 October 2014|volume=20|issue=2|pages=8–11|doi=10.1002/cplx.21615|bibcode=2014Cmplx..20b...8H}}</ref>
In October 2014, the WHO noted that exponential increase of cases continued in the three countries with the most intense transmission.<ref name=WHOvirtualpress>{{cite report|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/multimedia/vpc-23-october-2014.pdf?ua=1 |format= PDF|title=WHO Virtual Press Conference on the third meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee regarding the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa|publisher=WHO|access-date=5 November 2014}}</ref>

=== Projections of future cases ===

On 28 August 2014, the WHO released its first estimate of the possible total cases from the outbreak as part of its road map for stopping the transmission of the virus. It stated that "this Roadmap assumes that in many areas of intense transmission the actual number of cases may be two- to fourfold higher than that currently reported. It acknowledges that the aggregate case load of Ebola could exceed 20,000 over the course of this emergency. The Roadmap assumes that a rapid escalation of the complementary strategies in intense transmission, resource-constrained areas will allow the comprehensive application of more standard containment strategies within three months." The report included an assumption that some country or countries would pay the required cost of their plan, estimated at half a billion US dollars.<ref name=res/>

When the WHO released these estimates, a number of epidemiologists presented data to show that the WHO projection of a total of 20,000 cases was likely an underestimate.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kupferschmidt|first1=Kai|title=Disease modelers project a rapidly rising toll from Ebola|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2014/08/disease-modelers-project-rapidly-rising-toll-ebola|publisher=Science (news)|access-date= 11 April 2015|date=2014-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Early Transmission Dynamics of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), West Africa, March to August 2014 |journal=Eurosurveillance | date=11 September 2014 | author=Nishiura, H | author2=Chowell, G | volume=19 | issue=36 |pages=20894 |doi=10.2807/1560-7917.ES2014.19.36.20894 |pmid=25232919 |doi-access=free }}</ref> On 9 September, Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the [[Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine]] in Germany, controversially announced that the containment fight in Sierra Leone and Liberia had already been "lost" and that the disease would "burn itself out".<ref>{{cite news|title=Virologist: Fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone and Liberia is lost|url=http://www.dw.de/virologist-fight-against-ebola-in-sierra-leone-and-liberia-is-lost/a-17915090|date=11 September 2014|access-date=11 September 2014|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}</ref>

On 23 September 2014, the WHO revised their previous projection, stating that they expected the number of Ebola cases in Western Africa to be in excess of 20,000 by 2 November 2014.<ref name=":1" /> They further stated, that if the disease was not adequately contained it could become native in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, "spreading as routinely as malaria or the flu",<ref>{{cite news|last1=Szabo|first1=Liz|title=Could the Ebola outbreak last forever?|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/22/ebola-last-forever/16072019/|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=22 September 2014|date=22 September 2014}}</ref> and according to an editorial in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], eventually to other parts of Africa and beyond.<ref name="The Ebola Emergency — Immediate Action, Ongoing Strategy">{{cite journal|title=The Ebola Emergency — Immediate Action, Ongoing Strategy |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |author=Farrar, Jeremy J. |date=23 September 2014 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe1411471 |pmid=25244185 |volume=371 |issue = 16|pages=1545–1546|url=https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/1947014/1/nejme1411471.pdf }}</ref>

In a report released on 23 September 2014, the CDC analysed the impact of under-reporting, which required correction of case numbers by a factor of up to 2.5. With this correction factor, approximately 21,000 total cases were estimated for the end of September 2014 in Liberia and Sierra Leone alone. The same report predicted that total cases, including unreported cases, could reach 1.4 million in Liberia and Sierra Leone by the end of January 2015 if no improvement in intervention or community behaviour occurred.<ref name="CDC Estimating future number of cases" /> However, at a congressional hearing on 19 November, the Director of the CDC said that the number of Ebola cases was no longer expected to exceed 1 million, moving away from the [[worst-case scenario]] that had been previously predicted.<ref>{{cite news|title=Overnight Health: Congress begs for attention on Ebola|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/overnights/224766-overnight-health-congress-begs-for-attention-on-ebola|newspaper=The Hill|access-date=20 November 2014|date=2014-11-19}}</ref>

A study published in December 2014 found that transmission of the Ebola virus occurs principally within families, in hospitals and at funerals. The data, gathered during three weeks of contact tracing in August, showed that the third person in any transmission chain often knew both the first and second person. The authors estimated that between 17% and 70% of cases in Western Africa were unreported—far fewer than had been estimated in prior projections. The study concluded that the epidemic would not be as difficult to control as feared, if rapid, vigorous contact tracing and quarantines were employed.<ref name=NYT_fewer_unreported>{{cite news|title=Fewer Ebola Cases Go Unreported Than Thought, Study Finds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/science/fewer-ebola-cases-go-unreported-than-thought-study-finds-.html?_r=0|date=16 December 2014 |access-date= 11 April 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|first=Donald G.|last=McNeil Jr}}</ref>

Projections of future cases should also reflect the possibility that [[deforestation]] might have a hand in terms of the more recent Ebola outbreaks. It has been suggested that due to the clearing of forest for commercial use, various types of bats namely '' fruit bats'' may be taken out of their natural habitat and therefore into closer and potential contact with civilisation.<ref name="defor2">{{cite journal |last1=Nasi |first1=Robert |last2=Sheil |first2=Douglas |last3=Leendertz |first3=Siv Aina |last4=King |first4=Shona |last5=Suter |first5=Jamison |last6=Park |first6=Douglas |last7=Salim |first7=Mohammad A. |last8=Gaveau |first8=David |last9=Vargas |first9=J.

== Economic effects ==
[[File:UNDG.gif|thumb|UNDG, improves efficiency in needing countries]]
In addition to the loss of life, the outbreak had a number of significant economic impacts.  In March 2015, the United Nations Development Group reported that due to a decrease in trade, closing of borders, flight cancellations, and drop in foreign investment and tourism activity fuelled by stigma, the epidemic resulted in vast economic consequences both in the affected areas and throughout Africa.<ref name="auto2" />  A September 2014 report in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' suggested that the economic impact of the Ebola outbreak could kill more people than the disease itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiannews.net/index.php/sid/225466201|publisher=Australian News.Net|title=IMF says Ebola impacted West African nations may need economic assistance}}</ref>

With regard to Ebola and economic activity in the country of Liberia, a study found that 8% of automotive firms, 8% of construction firms, 15% of food businesses and 30% of restaurants had closed due to the Ebola outbreak. Montserrado county experienced up to 20% firm closure. This indicated a decline in the Liberian national economy during the outbreak, as well as an indication that the county of Montserrado was hardest hit economically. The capital city Monrovia suffered construction and restaurant unemployment the most, while outside the capital, the food and beverage sectors suffered economically. A recuperation in the economy, at the end of the outbreak, was expected to be more rapid in some sectors than in others. Also, if the massive decline in economic activity persisted, the authors suggested a focus on economic recovery in addition to support for the healthcare system. The [[World Bank]] had projected an estimated loss of $1.6 billion in productivity for all three affected Western African countries combined for 2015. In Liberian counties that were less affected by the outbreak, the number of individuals employed fell by 24%. Montserrado saw a 47% decline in employment per firm in contrast to what was obtained prior to the Ebola outbreak.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ebola, jobs and economic activity in Liberia|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=70|issue=3|pages=271–277|author=Jeremy Bowles|doi=10.1136/jech-2015-205959|pmid=26438188|pmc=4789821|year=2016}}</ref>

Another study showed that the economic effect of the Ebola outbreak would be felt for years due to preexisting [[social vulnerability]]. The economic effects were being felt nationwide in Liberia, such as the termination of expansions in the mining business. Initial scenarios had placed expected economic losses at $25 billion; however subsequent World Bank estimates were much lower, at about 12% of the combined [[GDP]] of the 3 worst hit countries.<ref name="stanturf">{{cite journal|last1=Stanturf|first1=John A.|last2=Goodrick|first2=Scott L.|last3=Jr|first3=Melvin L.

In spite of the end of civil violence since 2003 and inflows from international donors, the reconstruction of Liberia had been very slow and non-productive—water delivery systems, sanitation facilities and centralised electricity were practically non-existent, even in Monrovia. Even before the outbreak, medical facilities did not have potable water, lighting or refrigeration.

In July 2014, the WHO convened an emergency meeting of health ministers from eleven countries and announced collaboration on a strategy to co-ordinate technical support to combat the epidemic. In August they published a road map to guide and coordinate the international response to the outbreak, aiming to stop ongoing Ebola transmission worldwide within 6–9 months, and formally designated the outbreak as a [[Public Health Emergency of International Concern]].<ref name=WHO_PHEIC_8Aug2014 /> This is a legal designation used only twice before (for the [[2009 flu pandemic|2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic]] and the 2014 resurgence of poliomyelitis) that invokes legal measures on disease prevention, surveillance, control, and response, by 194 signatory countries.<ref name="Reuters20k">{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-who-plan-idUSKBN0GS0XC20140828|title=WHO says Ebola outbreak could strike 20,000 people|work=Reuters|date=28 August 2014|access-date=28 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="urlInside Justice-WHO-PHEIC">{{cite news|url=http://www.insidejustice.com/intl/2009/04/30/swine_flu_who_pheic/ |publisher=Inside Justice |title=Swine Flu: Legal Obligations and Consequences When the WHO Declares a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern" |first=Renée |last=Dopplick |date=29 April 2009 |access-date=6 June 2014}}</ref>

In 2015 a panel of experts looked at the ways of preventing small outbreaks from becoming large epidemics. Their recommendations were published in the November issue of ''[[The Lancet]]''.  According to the panel, the epidemic had exposed problems in the national (and international) institutions responsible for protecting the public from the human consequences of infectious disease outbreaks such as the Ebola epidemic.  The panel was highly critical of the WHO's management of the Ebola crisis noting that it took them months to respond and when they did they were slow to act, poorly co-ordinated and inadequately informed.  The report pointed out that the committee responsible for checking the WHO's actions during the outbreak (i.e. the WHO Ebola Interim Assessment Panel) had delayed responses due to worries about political resistance from the Western African leaders, economic consequences, and a system within the WHO that discouraged open debate about issues such as emergency declarations. The WHO may also have hesitated because it was criticised for creating panic by declaring a public health emergency during the relatively mild [[2009 H1N1 pandemic]].

The panel outlined 10 recommendations for the prevention and handling of future infectious disease outbreaks.  Included in the recommendations of the changes needed to fight future outbreaks is the creation of a U.N. Security Council health committee to expedite political attention to health issues and the establishment of a global fund to finance and accelerate the development of outbreak-relevant drugs and treatment.  The report also noted that competent governance of the global system demanded political leadership and a WHO that is more focused and appropriately financed and whose integrity is restored through the application of adequate reforms and leadership.<ref name="lancet"/>

The WHO also came under fire for refusing to send Dr. Olivet Buck to Germany for experimental treatment after she contracted Ebola per the government of Sierra Leone's request. WHO claimed they could only evacuate medical professionals they had deployed to the region, not locals. Dr. Olivet Buck was the Medical Superintendent at Lumley Government Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone. It's believed that she contracted the virus while continuing to treat patients even during a shortage of personal protective equipment. Her loyalty and dedication to her community never wavered.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Andrew |title=Remembering health workers who died from Ebola in 2014 |journal=The Lancet |date=20 December 2014 |volume=384 |issue=9961 |pages=2201–2206 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62417-X |pmid=25625389 |s2cid=23124192 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)62417-X/fulltext |access-date=29 February 2020 |language=en |issn=0140-6736}}</ref>

* ''[[Fevers, Feuds, and Diamonds: Ebola and the Ravages of History]]''. [[Paul Farmer]]. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2020. {{ISBN|978-0374234324}}

:Paul Farmer is a medical anthropologist and physician, and the co-founder of [[Partners in Health]].  Farmer first visited the Ebola outbreak site in July, 2014, and he devotes much of the book to his personal experiences.  Reviewing the outbreak in 2020, he noted that there were almost no Ebola deaths in the U.S. or Europe.  By Farmer's account, the West Africa Ebola death toll arose from the longstanding failure to invest in basic health infrastructure which resulted in a lack of proper medical care.  Looking at the history of West Africa, Farmer blames the almost five centuries of European rule that resulted in the "rapacious extraction — of rubber latex, timber, minerals, gold, diamonds and human chattel" for the country's inability to provide adequate health care.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Steven |title=The Deadliness of the 2014 Ebola Outbreak Was Not Inevitable |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/books/review/fevers-feuds-and-diamonds-paul-farmer.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=17 November 2020 |access-date=18 February 2021}}</ref>
