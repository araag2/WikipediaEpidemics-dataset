The '''2019 Philippines measles outbreak''' began in early 2019. An [[outbreak]] of [[measles]] was officially declared in February 2019 in select administrative regions in Luzon and Visayas including Metro Manila by the Philippine government. The outbreak is attributed to lowered vaccination rates, from a high of 88% 10 to 15 years previous to 74% at the time of the outbreak, allegedly caused by the [[Dengvaxia controversy]].

==Cause==
Vaccination against measles is available for free in government hospitals and health centers but there is a lowered trust in vaccination in the country. According to an opinion poll conducted by the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] in 2018, 32 percent of the surveyed 1,500 Filipinos trusted vaccines. In the 2015 iteration of the poll, 93 percent of the respondents said they trusted vaccines. Health Secretary [[Francisco Duque III]] attributes the lowered trust on the government's immunization drive due to the [[Dengvaxia controversy]].<ref name=declares3>{{cite news |title=Measles outbreak declared in 3 more regions |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/07/19/measles-outbreaks-declared-in-more-luzon-visayas-areas |access-date=9 February 2019 |work=ABS-CBN News |date=7 February 2019}}</ref>

The [[UNICEF|United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund]] (UNICEF) said that the outbreak is caused by "failure of the health system" saying that the distribution of vaccines down to the barangay level has not worked properly. They cited that immunization rates in the country have been declining in the past 10 to 15 years with about 74% immunized at the time of the outbreak compared to a high of 88%; 10 or 15 years ago.<ref name=unicef/> UNICEF and the WHO has also attributed increase vaccine hesitancy in 2018 due to the Dengue vaccine controversy as a factor contributing to the outbreak.<ref name="unicefwho11"/> Statistical data from UNICEF, however, shows that decline in Measles vaccination began as early as 2014, four years before the Dengvaxia controversy happened.<ref>[https://data.unicef.org//wp-content/uploads/country_profiles/Philippines/Immunization-coverage-estimates-2018_phl.pdf Philippines: WHO and UNICEF estimates of immunization coverage: 2018 revision] ''data.unicef.org'' accessed 15 May 2020</ref>

As of March 1, 2019, 62 percent of all cases recorded at that time involved individuals who were not vaccinated against measles.<ref name="ndrrmcsitrepno5"/>
