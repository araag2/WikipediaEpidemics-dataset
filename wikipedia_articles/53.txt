==Potential for further international spread==

On 28 March, ProMED-mail moderators [[John "Jack" P. Woodall|Jack Woodall]] and Tom Yuill issued a strongly worded warning on the threat of yellow fever for countries that have endemic dengue fever (and thus the mosquito vector of yellow fever and dengue fever, [[Aedes aegypti]]), and particularly for countries in Asia, where until recently yellow fever has never appeared.

==Response to the epidemic==
In June 2016, a WHO representative in Luanda said that the initial investigation of the outbreak in December was thrown off course because the first cases in December 2015—the sick Eritrean visitors—had what were later identified as fake yellow fever vaccination certificates. All had been to the same restaurant, so food poisoning was initially suspected as the cause of the mystery illness.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Times|first1=Los Angeles|title=Yellow fever outbreak: Health officials to weigh declaring global emergency|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/global-development/la-fg-global-yellow-fever-snap-story.html|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=12 June 2016}}</ref> It was more than a month before blood samples from the Eritreans reached the Pasteur Institute lab and yellow fever was recognized.
