{{Coronavirus}}
Since 2012, an outbreak of [[Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus]] has affected several countries, primarily in its namesake, the [[Middle East]]. The virus, which causes [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS), is a [[novel coronavirus]] that was first identified in a patient from [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]] on June 6, 2012.

Sporadic cases, small clusters, and large outbreaks have been reported in 24 countries, with over 2,500 cases of the virus and over 900 deaths, as of 2021.<ref name=":1" />

==Coronavirus==
Most infections with human [[coronavirus]]es are mild and associated with common colds. The seven coronaviruses known to infect humans are in the alpha and beta [[genera]]. Both [[Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus|MERS-CoV]] and [[SARS coronavirus|SARS-CoV]] (severe acute respiratory syndrome) are betacoronaviruses.<ref name="zaki8nov2012"/><ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/348643/description/Scientists_race_to_understand_deadly_new_virus | title=Scientists race to understand deadly new virus: SARS-like infection causes severe illness, but may not spread quickly | magazine=[[Science News]] | date=27 February 2013 | last=Saey | first=Tina Hesman | number=6 | volume=183 | page=5}}</ref>

The Fourth Meeting of the [[International Health Regulations]] Emergency Committee concerning MERS-CoV was held on 4 December 2013. The committee decided that the conditions for a [[Public health emergency of international concern|Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)]] had not at present been met.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2013/mers_cov_20131204/en/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414080010/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2013/mers_cov_20131204/en/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=14 April 2014 | title=WHO Statement on the Fourth Meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee concerning MERS-CoV | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] | date=4 December 2014 | access-date=24 April 2014 | last=Härtl | first=Gregory}}</ref>

On 8 November 2012, in an article published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], Dr. Zaki and co-authors from the Erasmus Medical Center published more details, including a scientific name, Human Coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center ([[MERS coronavirus EMC/2012|HCoV-EMC]]), which was then used in scientific literature.<ref name="zaki8nov2012">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1211721 |pmid=23075143 |title=Isolation of a Novel Coronavirus from a Man with Pneumonia in Saudi Arabia |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=367 |issue=19 |pages=1814–1820 |year=2012 |last1=Zaki |first1=Ali M |last2=Van Boheemen |first2=Sander |last3=Bestebroer |first3=Theo M |last4=Osterhaus |first4=Albert D.M.E |last5=Fouchier |first5=Ron A.M |doi-access=free }}</ref> In the article, they noted four respiratory human coronaviruses (HCoV) known to be endemic: 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1.<ref name=zaki8nov2012 />

In May 2014, the WHO said it was monitoring the situation as global cases of MERS appeared to be on the rise, but said the situation did not yet constitute a health emergency.  On 3 June 2014, Saudi Arabia revised the country's total cases of MERS to date to 688 cases after re-examining the data as part of an effort to better understand the disease.  A total of 282 people had died from MERS.  The numbers represented a jump of 113 cases and 92 deaths.  Despite the jump in reported cases, the number of new cases was on the decline according to Tariq Madany, head of the medical advisory council.  At the same time, the Saudi deputy health minister was fired, the second high level health official fired within two months.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/03/saudi-arabia-mers_n_5438745.html | title=Saudi Arabia Review Finds Higher Number Of MERS Cases | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=3 June 2014 | agency=[[Associated Press]] | access-date=5 June 2014}}</ref>

On 4 June 2014, a study published in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' indicated that camel-to-human transmission of the virus was possible.  In November 2013, a man became ill with MERS after tending to a sick camel.  Viral samples taken from the man, who eventually died of the virus, and the sick animal were virtually identical. This provided very strong evidence that the man had gotten the virus from the camel.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/science/dna-test-indicates-camel-to-human-transmission-of-mers.html | title=DNA Test Indicates Camel-to-Human Transmission of MERS | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=5 June 2014 | access-date=5 June 2014 | author=Donald G.
