The '''2009 Bolivian dengue fever epidemic''' was an [[epidemic]] of [[dengue fever]] which struck [[Bolivia]] in early 2009, escalating into a national emergency by February. The [[BBC]] described it as the worst outbreak of dengue fever in the country's history. At least 18 people died and 31,000 were infected by the [[mosquito]]-transmitted arbovirus.

On 20 February, the [[Pan American Health Organization]] reported that eighty (80) cases of the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever had occurred in Bolivia since January, of which 22% were fatal.<ref name="Dengue fever worsens in Bolivia"/> Bolivia requested outside assistance and foreign aid.

== Background ==
Bolivia first declared a national emergency in early February 2009, when it alerted the world about the country's worst outbreak of dengue fever in twenty-two years.<ref name="Dengue fever outbreak in Bolivia">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7866908.stm|title=Dengue fever outbreak in Bolivia |date=2009-02-03|access-date=2009-02-26|publisher=[[BBC]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090206170249/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7866908.stm| archivedate= 6 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> By 3 February, five people had died in the east of the country and over 7,000 more were infected.<ref name="Dengue fever outbreak in Bolivia"/> Worst hit is the [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]], near the [[Paraguay]]an border and the [[Amazon River|Amazon]].<ref name="Dengue fever outbreak in Bolivia"/> A number of military facilities, particularly in the city of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]], were turned into temporary hospitals as the real hospitals struggled to cope with the conditions.<ref name="Dengue fever outbreak in Bolivia"/> Thousands of soldiers were mobilized to assist medical workers.<ref name="Dengue fever outbreak in Bolivia"/> The government then allocated funds to supply hospitals across the country; however, it was criticised in some quarters for the slowness of its actions.<ref name="Dengue fever worsens in Bolivia"/><ref name="Dengue fever outbreak in Bolivia"/> The infection was most widespread in the tropical eastern lowlands, where conditions led to a thriving mosquito population.<ref name="Dengue fever worsens in Bolivia"/> Bolivia's healthcare services had difficulty in coping with the outbreak, with experts from [[Venezuela]], [[Cuba]], [[Paraguay]] and the [[World Health Organization]] called in to assist.<ref name="Dengue fever worsens in Bolivia"/>
