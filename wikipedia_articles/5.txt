The 2002–2004 outbreak of [[SARS]], caused by [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1|severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus]] (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1), infected over 8,000 people from 29 different countries and territories, and resulted in at least 774 deaths worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/deadly-sars-virus-history-2003-in-photos-2020-2|title=How SARS terrified the world in 2003, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing 774|work=Business Insider|date=20 February 2020|access-date=2 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302170811/https://www.businessinsider.com/deadly-sars-virus-history-2003-in-photos-2020-2|archive-date=2 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

The first [[super-spreader]], Zhou Zuofen, a [[fishmonger]], checked in to the [[Sun Yat-sen University|Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital]] in [[Guangzhou]] on 31 January, where he infected 30 nurses and doctors. The virus soon spread to nearby hospitals.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scientists wait for next mass killer to spill over from nature |author=Peter McGrath |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/analysis/scientists-wait-for-next-mass-killer-to-spill-over-from-nature-1-5399130 |newspaper=[[The Yorkshire Post]] |date=12 February 2013 |access-date=26 January 2020 |format=Zhou is erroneously named Zhou Zoufeng in the article |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126133749/https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/analysis/scientists-wait-for-next-mass-killer-to-spill-over-from-nature-1-5399130 |archive-date=26 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Hotel Metropole 9th floor layout SARS 2003.svg|thumbnail|Ninth floor layout of the Hotel Metropole in Hong Kong, showing where a [[Super-spreader|super-spreading]] event of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred]]
In February 2003, Liu Jianlun became Hong Kong's SARS [[index case|index patient]]. He had come to attend a family wedding gathering; Liu was on the staff at [[Sun Yat-sen University|Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital]] in [[Guangzhou]] and had treated SARS patients.<ref>{{cite book |last=Abraham |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Abraham |date=2004 |title=Twenty-first Century Plague: The Story of SARS |url=https://archive.org/details/twentyfirstcentu00thom |website=archive.org |isbn=9780801881244 |url-access=registration |access-date=22 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226203419/https://archive.org/details/twentyfirstcentu00thom |archive-date=26 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On 21 February, Liu and his wife checked into room 911 on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel. Despite feeling ill he visited with his family and they traveled around Hong Kong. By the morning of 22 February, he knew he was very sick and walked to the Accident and Emergency Department of [[Kwong Wah Hospital]] to seek treatment. He was treated by the triage nurse and doctor without protective measures even though a memorandum on surveillance of severe community-acquired pneumonia had been issued by the [[Hospital Authority| Hospital Authority of Hong Kong]]. After the Liu's chest X-ray taken in Kwong Wah Hospital became available, staff became aware of the situation, wearing personal protective equipment and full isolation inside the [[Intensive care unit|ICU]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr03-04/english/sc/sc_sars/reports/sars_rpt.htm|title=Select Committee to inquire into the handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak by the Government and the Hospital Authority|website=www.legco.gov.hk}}</ref>

Liu is believed to have been a SARS super-spreader: 23 other Metropole guests developed SARS, including seven from the ninth floor. Liu's brother-in-law, who sought treatment in late February, was hospitalized in Kwong Wah Hospital on 1 March and died on 19 March. It is estimated that around 80% of the Hong Kong cases were due to Liu.<ref name="Khan2016">Khan, Ali S. & Patrick, William. (2016). "The Next Pandemic." New York: PublicAffairs.</ref>

====Vietnam====
The virus was carried to [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]], by Chinese-American Johnny Chen, a resident of Shanghai who had roomed across the hall from Liu at the Metropole. He was admitted to the [[French Hospital of Hanoi]] on 26 February, where he infected at least 38 members of the staff. Even though he was evacuated to Hong Kong, he died on 13 March.<ref name="Khan2016"/> [[Carlo Urbani]], a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) infectious disease specialist, was among the staff who examined Chen. Urbani observed that other hospital staff were already falling ill and realized that he was dealing with a new and dangerous disease. He himself became infected and died on 29 March.<ref name=Khan2016/>

On 23 February, an elderly woman named Kwan Sui-Chu who had also been a Metropole Hotel guest, returned to [[Toronto]], Canada, from Hong Kong. She died at home on 5 March, after infecting her son Tse Chi Kwai, who subsequently spread the disease to [[Birchmount Hospital|Scarborough Grace Hospital]] and died on 13 March.<ref>{{cite book |last=Low |first=Donald |author-link=Donald Low |date=2004 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92467/ |pages=63–71 |title=Learning from SARS: Preparing for the Next Disease Outbreak: Workshop Summary |publisher=National Academies Press (US) |access-date=28 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224085530/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92467/ |archive-date=24 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Taiwan====
The first cases of atypical pneumonia in Taiwan were identified in a Guangdong-based businessman and his wife on 14 March and confirmed on 17 March.

On 11 March, Carlo Urbani travelled to [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], to attend a medical conference. He fell ill during the flight and told a friend waiting at Bangkok not to touch him, to call an ambulance and take him to a hospital. He was isolated in an intensive care unit. A similar outbreak of a mysterious respiratory infection was reported among Hong Kong healthcare workers.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

On 12 March, WHO issued a global alert about a new infectious disease of unknown origin in both Vietnam and Hong Kong. On 15 March, WHO issued a heightened global health alert about a mysterious pneumonia with a case definition of SARS after cases in Singapore and Canada were also identified. The alert included a rare emergency travel advisory to international travelers, healthcare professionals, and health authorities. The [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) issued a travel advisory stating that persons considering travel to the affected areas in Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and China) should not go.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

On 17 March, an international network of 11 laboratories was established to determine the cause of SARS and develop potential treatments. The CDC held its first briefing on SARS and said that 14 suspected SARS cases were being investigated in the US. On 20 March, WHO reported that several hospitals in Vietnam and Hong Kong were operating with half the usual staff because many workers stayed home out of fear of getting infected. WHO raised the concern that substandard care of the infected patients might contribute to the spread of the disease.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

On 25 March, Hong Kong authorities stated that nine tourists had contracted the disease from a mainland Chinese man who had boarded the same plane on 15 March, [[Air China Flight 112]] to Beijing.<ref name=Koh2003>{{Cite journal|last1=Koh|first1=D.|last2=Lim|first2=M.

On 30 March, Hong Kong authorities quarantined estate E of the [[Amoy Gardens]] housing estate due to a massive (200+ cases) outbreak in the building. The balcony was completely closed and guarded by the police. The residents of the building were later transferred to the quarantined [[Lei Yue Mun Holiday Camp]] and Lady MacLehose Holiday Village on 1 April because the building was deemed a health hazard.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Most of the cases were linked to apartments with a north-western orientation which shared the same sewage pipe. According to government officials, the virus was brought into the estate by an infected [[kidney]] patient (the type of kidney illness was not specified) after discharge from [[Prince of Wales Hospital]], who visited his elder brother living on the seventh floor. Through excretion, the virus spread through drainage. One theory speculated that the virus was spread by [[airborne transmission]], through dried up U-shaped P-traps in the drainage system which a maritime breeze blew into the estate's balconies and stairwell ventilation. It was confirmed that the virus spread via droplets, but this later outbreak made officials question the possibility that the virus could be spread through the air.<ref name="LiAirborneSARS">{{cite journal |last1=Li Y, Huang X, Yu IT, Wong TW, Qian H |title=Role of air distribution in SARS transmission during the largest nosocomial outbreak in Hong Kong |journal=Indoor Air |date=April 2005 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=83–95 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00317.x |pmid=15737151 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00317.x |access-date=11 June 2021}}</ref>
