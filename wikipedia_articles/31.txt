The '''2008 Zimbabwean cholera outbreak''' was an epidemic of [[cholera]] affecting much of Zimbabwe from August 2008 until June 2009. The [[Disease outbreak|outbreak]] began in [[Chitungwiza]] in [[Mashonaland East Province]] in August 2008, then spread throughout the country so that by December 2008, cases were being reported in all 10 [[Zimbabwe#Administrative divisions|provinces]].<ref name=ICDDRB>{{cite journal|author1=Ahmed S |author2=Bardhan PK |author3=Mazumder RN |author4=Khan AI |author5=Islam MS |author6=Siddique AK |author7=Cravioto A |title=The 2008 Cholera Epidemic in Zimbabwe: Experience of the icddr,b Team in the Field |journal=Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition |date=October 2011 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=541–546 |pmc=3225117 |pmid=22106761|doi=10.3329/jhpn.v29i5.8909 }}</ref> In December 2008, The [[Government of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean government]] declared the outbreak a [[national emergency]] and requested [[international aid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/12/04/zimbabwe.cholera.emergency/ |access-date=26 May 2016 |title=Zimbabwe declares cholera national emergency |date=9 December 2008 |publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref> The outbreak peaked in January 2009 with 8,500 cases reported per week.<ref name=WHOZim/> Cholera cases from this outbreak were also reported in neighboring countries [[South Africa]], [[Malawi]], [[Botswana]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Zambia]].<ref name=WHOZim/> With the help of international agencies, the outbreak was controlled, and by July 2009, after no cases had been reported for several weeks, the [[Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (Zimbabwe)|Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare]] declared the outbreak over.<ref name=WHOZim/> In total, 98,596 cases of cholera and 4,369 deaths were reported, making this the largest outbreak of cholera ever recorded in Zimbabwe.<ref name=WHOZim>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/cholera/countries/ZimbabweCountryProfileOct2009.pdf |access-date=26 May 2016 |title=Cholera Country Profile: Zimbabwe |date=31 October 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization - Global Task Force on Cholera Control}}</ref> The large scale and severity of the outbreak has been attributed to poor sanitation, limited access to [[Health care|healthcare]], and insufficient healthcare infrastructure throughout Zimbabwe.<ref name=WHOZim/><ref name=MSF>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/special-report/beyond-cholera-zimbabwes-worsening-crisis |access-date=26 May 2016 |title=Beyond Cholera: Zimbabwe's Worsening Crisis |publisher=[[Medecins Sans Frontieres]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807031713/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/special-report/beyond-cholera-zimbabwes-worsening-crisis |archive-date=7 August 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Cause ==
[[File:Kuwadzana open drain.JPG|250px|thumb|left|An open drain in [[Kuwadzana]] township, [[Harare]] in 2004. By 2008 drains such as this were carrying sewage from burst sewage pipes and [[feces]] washed out of the neighbouring areas as the urban sanitation system collapsed. This contributed to the rapid spread of the cholera outbreak.]]
The 2008 cholera outbreak was caused by widespread infection with the bacterium ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' which is spread through water contaminated with the feces of infected individuals. Cholera had been seen in Zimbabwe in the decade leading up to the 2008 outbreak.<ref name=WHOZim/> However, the severity of the 2008 has been attributed to a combination of societal factors including poor access to [[health care]] and poor [[Health system|health care infrastructure]], high [[HIV]] prevalence, [[political instability]], food shortages, high levels of [[displaced person|displaced people]], and lack of access to [[potable water|safe water]].<ref name=MSF/> In 2008, Zimbabwe was suffering from an [[Economy of Zimbabwe#2000–2009|economic crisis]] and [[Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe|hyperinflation]] which led to shortages of food and other basic goods, disruption of public services, and a large number of refugees moving within the country and to neighboring countries.<ref name=MSF/><ref name=PHR>{{cite web|publisher=Physicians for Human Rights |title=Health in Ruins: A Man-Made Disaster in Zimbabwe |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/health-in-ruins-zim-full-2009.pdf |access-date=28 February 2012 |date=January 2009}}</ref>

<!--Water and Sanitation--> 
One of the major contributing factors to the outbreak was the breakdown of the [[Municipality|municipal]] [[water supply]], [[sanitation]], and [[Waste management|waste collection]] programs throughout the country, but especially in urban areas.<ref name=collapse/> With this, the onset of the rainy season led to cholera-contaminated [[faeces]] being washed into water sources, in particular public drains,<ref name=storm/><ref name=rain/> as well as providing readily available but contaminated water.<ref name=coping>{{cite news|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/zimbabwe-feature-261108?opendocument|title=Zimbabwe: coping with the cholera outbreak|date=26 November 2008|access-date=3 December 2008}}</ref> Due to a shortage of purification chemicals, such as chlorine, the capital city of [[Harare]] stopped receiving piped water on 1 December 2008.<ref name=mobilize>{{cite news|url=http://www.zwnews.net/issuefull.cfm?ArticleID=19803 |title=United Nations, Red Cross mobilize cholera relief for Zimbabwe |date=3 December 2008 |publisher=VOA news |access-date=2008-12-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208024523/http://www.zwnews.net/issuefull.cfm?ArticleID=19803 |archive-date=8 December 2008 }}</ref> By that date, many suburbs had not had any water supply for much longer.<ref name=3000dead/> On 4 December 2008, the Zimbabwe deputy minister for water and infrastructural development stated that there were only sufficient treatment chemicals in stock nationally for 12 weeks supply.<ref name=appeal>{{cite news|url=http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL4384569.html|title=Zimbabwe appeals for donor help on cholera|date=4 December 2008|work=Reuters|access-date=4 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206151851/http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL4384569.html|archive-date=6 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The collapse of these systems was blamed on the then-current [[Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe|economic crisis]];<ref name="Capital lacks clean water, cholera kills hundreds in Zimbabwe"/><ref name=oxfam>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e8d897e4-c0db-11dd-b0a8-000077b07658.html|title=Cholera death rate multiplies in Zimbabwe's economic crisis|date=3 December 2008|publisher=Financial Times (UK)|access-date=4 December 2008}}</ref> many households cannot afford fuel to boil water.<ref name=oxfam2/> According to [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], the spread of cholera from urban to rural areas from December 2008 onwards was due to infected city-dwellers visiting their families' rural homes for Christmas and the burial of infected city-dwellers in rural areas.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cholera moves to rural Zimbabwe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7844417.stm|date=22 January 2009|publisher=BBC|access-date=22 January 2009}}</ref>

The 2008 cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe had an unusually high [[Case fatality rate|fatality rate]]; Oxfam attributed the high mortality to a population "seriously weakened by hunger, [[HIV/AIDS|HIV and AIDS]]".<ref name=oxfam2/> A major contributing factor to the severity of the outbreak was the collapse of Zimbabwe's public health system, declared a national emergency on 4 December 2008.<ref name=emergency>{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hsW9YNn1roEp0rzjeGSJo0pKcj2A|title=Zimbabwe declares cholera outbreak a national emergency|date=4 December 2008|publisher=AFP|access-date=4 December 2008}}</ref> By the end of November 2008, three of Zimbabwe's four major hospitals had shut down, along with the Zimbabwe Medical School, and the fourth major hospital had two wards and no operating theatres working.<ref name=hospitals>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7714892.stm|title=The death throes of Harare's hospitals|date=7 November 2008|publisher=BBC |access-date=3 December 2008}}</ref><ref name=hospitals2>{{cite news|url=http://www.radiovop.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4452&Itemid=755|title=Zimbabwe's Medical School Closes|date=19 November 2008|publisher=Radio VOP|access-date=3 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206141027/http://www.radiovop.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4452&Itemid=755|archive-date=6 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Zimbabwean hospitals still open by December 2008 lacked medicines and staff.

==Prevention==
After the 2008 epidemic was declared a national emergency, the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MOHCW) collaborated with several other departments, governments, and non-governmental organizations to create a Cholera Command and Control Centre. This centre works to prevent cholera outbreaks in Zimbabwe by addressing broader societal factors that could contribute to cholera outbreaks, such as water sanitation and poor hygiene habits.<ref name=socialdeterminants />

== Politicisation ==
Because of its well-organised health care system and effective water sanitation facilities, [[Rita R. Colwell]] of the [[James Baker Institute]] says Zimbabwe was historically one of the African countries least affected by cholera.<ref name ="bakerinstitute"/> A news commentary in ''[[The Lancet]]'' said that, under President [[Robert Mugabe]], the country's health programs were negatively impacted, resulting in diminished health care for those infected with cholera.<ref name=thelancet /> According to a draft paper from the WHO's World Conference on Social Determinants in Health, there were fewer health workers in the villages than in urban areas, which hindered early detection and isolation of cholera cases.<ref name=socialdeterminants>{{cite web|title=Intersectoral Actions in response to cholera in Zimbabwe: From emergency response to institution building|url=https://www.who.int/sdhconference/resources/draft_background_paper23_zimbabwe.pdf |work=World Conference on Social Determinants of Health |publisher= World Health Organization |access-date=30 November 2013 |date= 19–21 October 2011}}</ref>

A news commentator writing for ''The Lancet'', Andrew Meldrum, said that President Mugabe's Youth Militia threatened health professionals that provided medical treatment to political opponents.<ref name="thelancet">{{cite journal |author=Meldrum A |title=Zimbabwe's health-care system struggles on |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9618 |pages=1059–60 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18380032 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)60468-7/fulltext |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313084432/http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)60468-7/fulltext |url-status=live |archive-date=2011-03-13 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(08)60468-7 |s2cid=12356996 }}</ref> He said that, combined with decreasing education standards, low pay, and a shortage of medical supplies like latex gloves, this led doctors to leave Zimbabwe at an alarming rate.<ref name="thelancet" /> According to Douglas Gwatidzo, the chairman of the Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights group, Zimbabwe had only one doctor assigned to a group of 12,000 citizens.<ref name="thelancet" /> Doctors in Zimbabwe fill only 25% of the medical posts available, and even fewer specialist positions are taken.<ref name="thelancet" /> According to Meldrum, this poses serious challenges to health care for diseases like HIV/AIDS and cholera. Similarly, the effects of cholera are exacerbated without proper nutrition, and Zimbabwe has faced food shortages for the last several years.<ref name="thelancet" />

Cholera and malnutrition keep children out of school – a serious social consequence of the outbreak.  Rachel Pound, the director of [[Save the Children]] in Zimbabwe, said that attending school may be dangerous in Zimbabwe, instead of providing a ladder for self-improvement.  She noted that "Sanitation is now so bad in schools that they may become a breeding ground for infection", rather than a place of valuable education.<ref name="thelancet_a">{{cite journal |author=Kapp C |title=Zimbabwe's humanitarian crisis worsens |journal=Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9662 |pages=447 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19205080 |url= http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60151-3/fulltext |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60151-3|s2cid=5267332 }}</ref>

According to Meldrum, Zimbabwe's high inflation left the country with a lack of financial resources, resulting in a shortage of ambulances and pharmaceutical drugs.<ref name="thelancet" /> According to Eric Pruyt of the Delft University of Technology in The [[Netherlands]], this was exacerbated by a shortage of international aid, as Zimbabwe's government didn't acknowledge the epidemic and accept aid until the disease was widespread.<ref name="scholar.google">{{cite journal |author= Pruyt, Eric |title= Cholera in Zimbabwe |url= http://www.systemdynamics.org/conferences/2009/proceed/papers/P1357.pdf |date= 26 July 2009 |publisher= Delft University of Technology |access-date= 30 November 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131020151002/http://www.systemdynamics.org/conferences/2009/proceed/papers/P1357.pdf |archive-date= 20 October 2013 |url-status= dead}}</ref> It was not contained or prevented from spreading. Until 2008, the government insisted that there was no cholera in Zimbabwe,<ref name=scholar.google /> and Pruyt says the U.N. did not provide the country with safe drinking water until after the crisis started.<ref name=scholar.google /> Meldrum says that, during Zimbabwe's continuing HIV/AIDS dilemma, some major international donors did not give much money because they believed it would help President Mugabe stay in power, which they did not want.<ref name="thelancet" />

According to an editorial by Daniel J Ncayiyana in the ''South African Medical Journal'', President Mugabe blamed the U.S. and the U.K. for the cholera outbreak, saying that they sent the disease so that they have a reason to credibly remove him from the presidency.<ref name="scielo">{{cite journal |author=Ncayiyana DJ |title=The Zimbabwe mayhem--how many people must die for the neighbours to act? |journal=S.
