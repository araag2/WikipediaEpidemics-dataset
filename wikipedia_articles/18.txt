'''Mweka''' is a town in southern-central [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], situated on the [[Transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Kasai railway line]] between [[Kananga]] (250&nbsp;km away) and the [[Kasai River]] port of [[Ilebo]] (172&nbsp;km away).

Mweka is also the headquarters of the [[Territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Territoire de Mweka]] (administrative district) of the present [[Kasai Province]].
 
Its cathedral is the episcopal see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mweka]].

== Transport ==
When the rail connection to the [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] line is functioning, trains reach [[Lubumbashi]], 1,406&nbsp;km to the south-east of Mweka.<ref>[http://www.fahrplancenter.com/DRCongoSNCCLubum.html Société Nationale Des Chemins De Fer Du Congo: Réseau principal, écartement 1067&nbsp;mm] at www.fahrplancenter.com.</ref> The train/boat journey in the other direction from Mweka via Ilebo to the capital, [[Kinshasa]] is about 1,000&nbsp;km. Although "remote" is the default international media description for any DR&nbsp;Congo town outside Kinshasa, Mweka is relatively accessible by the standards of the country. Mweka Airport is 372&nbsp;nm (690&nbsp;km) east of Kinshasa.
