== Policy Response ==
The New Zealand Government has been criticised for its response to the epidemic, particularly due to shortages in the supply of vaccines.<ref>{{Cite news| url= https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/10/simon-bridges-hits-out-at-government-over-measles-outbreak-handling.html|title=Simon Bridges hits out at Government over measles outbreak handling|last=Fitzgerald|first=Katie|work=Newshub|access-date=2 October 2019|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/northern-advocate/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503450&objectid=12269504|title=47 measles cases in North, MP says not enough action|work=Northern Advocate|last=Laird|first=Lindy|date=20 September 2019|access-date=2 October 2019|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref> Scientists have also criticised the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]] for not acting on previous recommendations to conduct national 'catch-up' campaigns with the [[MMR vaccine]] prior to the outbreak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/116221847/shameful-measles-outbreak-predicted|title='Shameful' measles outbreak predicted|last=Hancock|first=Farah|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref>

In 2017 the New Zealand [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Health Ministry]] produced documents that showed an urgent need to increase measles immunisation among young people and that a "systematic, programmatic approach" was needed to address an immunity gap. <ref>{{Cite web|date=July 18, 2019|title=Measles outbreak: Call for national approach |url=https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1907/S00102/measles-outbreak-call-for-national-approach.htm|access-date=2021-02-05|website=www.scoop.co.nz}}</ref> Dr [[Nikki Turner (academic general practitioner)|Nikki Turner]], Chair of the National Measles Verification Committee, met in 2018 to discuss the immunisation gap. It was noted damage was historical and immunisation rates had improved but by 2019 the gap had not been fully addressed. Many young people did not know if they had been vaccinated which indicated that poor record keeping contributed to ineffective delivery.<ref name=turner>{{Cite web|title=A measles epidemic in New Zealand: Why did this occur and how can we prevent it occurring again?|url=https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/a-measles-epidemic-in-new-zealand-why-did-this-occur-and-how-can-we-prevent-it-occurring-again|access-date=2021-02-05|website=www.nzma.org.nz}}</ref> David Haymen and Turner concluded that the best way to close the immunity gap was to undertake a formal catch-up programme.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-05-25|title=Joining the dots: What’s really causing New Zealand’s measles epidemics|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/390561/joining-the-dots-what-s-really-causing-new-zealand-s-measles-epidemics|access-date=2021-02-05|website=RNZ|language=en-nz}}</ref>

Research into the 2019 epidemic traced its history and showed it was young infants who were most at risk, followed by teenagers and adults under the age of 30.<ref name=turner/> Analysis by the [[Immunisation Advisory Centre, New Zealand|Immunisation Advisory Centre]] found that a generation born between 1982 and 2007 had low immunization rates, and vaccination records are incomplete for that period as the National Immunisation Register was introduced in 2005.<ref name="Newton_2019">{{cite news |last1=Newton |first1=Kate |title=Joining the dots: What’s really causing New Zealand’s measles epidemics |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/in-depth/390561/joining-the-dots-what-s-really-causing-new-zealand-s-measles-epidemics |access-date=27 March 2021 |work=RNZ |date=25 May 2019 |language=en-nz}}</ref> Research also suggested management strategies such as a national campaign targeting the at-risk age groups; establishment of systems to ensure adequate supplies of vaccines; provision of support for their delivery at the practice level; and creative use of community facilities to improve accessibility.{{cn|date=June 2021}}

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand]], it became apparent that in the drive to obtain a vaccine for that outbreak, there was a stall in getting measles vaccination programmes rolled out effectively. Turner warned that because of this, it was possible that there would be "bigger problems with children dying from measles, and the damage from measles, than Covid."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nikki Turner: Let's keep our eyes on the ball - The University of Auckland|url=https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2020/11/02/immunisation-expert-nikki-turner-vaccine-awareness.html|access-date=2021-02-05|website=www.auckland.ac.nz}}</ref>

Although New Zealand has had a high demand for the MMR vaccine, resulting in a shortage, there has also been an increase in the number of people who have declined the vaccine since 2017.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Manisha|last2=Lee|first2=Adria D.|last3=Clemmons|first3=Nakia S.|last4=Redd|first4=Susan B.|last5=Poser|first5=Sarah|last6=Blog|first6=Debra|last7=Zucker|first7=Jane R.|last8=Leung|first8=Jessica|last9=Link-Gelles|author9-link=Ruth Link-Gelles|first9=Ruth|last10=Pham|first10=Huong|last11=Arciuolo|first11=Robert J.|date=11 October 2019|title=National Update on Measles Cases and Outbreaks — United States, January 1 – October 1, 2019|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume=68|issue=40|pages=893–896|doi=10.15585/mmwr.mm6840e2|issn=0149-2195|pmc=6788396|pmid=31600181}}</ref>
