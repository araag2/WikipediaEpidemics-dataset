The '''2019 Kuala Koh measles outbreak''' was a [[measles]] outbreak that occurred among the [[Orang Asli]] sub-group of [[Batek people]] in Kuala Koh Village in the state of [[Kelantan]], [[Malaysia]], from May until July.<ref name="nomadic tribe mystery illness">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/mystery-deaths-among-indigenous-malaysians-prompt-speculation|title=Malaysia's last indigenous nomadic tribe threatened by deadly mystery illness|author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen|publisher=The Guardian|date=11 June 2019|access-date=27 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827031244/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/mystery-deaths-among-indigenous-malaysians-prompt-speculation|archive-date=27 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following the sudden deaths of several villagers, the disease became a mystery among the villagers and public for nearly a month until it was identified by the [[Ministry of Health (Malaysia)|Malaysian Health Ministry]] in mid-June as measles.<ref name="confirmed measles"/><ref name="mystery disease">{{cite web|url=https://says.com/my/news/14-orang-asli-have-died-in-kelantan-within-a-month-here-s-all-you-need-to-know|title=14 Orang Asli Have Died In Kelantan Within A Month.

== Background of the disease ==
[[File:SemaiMap.png|thumb|left|146px|The range of the traditional territories of the [[Batek people]] in orange.]]
The sudden deaths of 14 [[Orang Asli]] villagers in Kuala Koh Village was at first considered a mystery with two of the victims dying from [[pneumonia]] complications between 2 May and 7 June, while the remaining victims' causes of death remain unknown as their bodies were buried by locals prior to reports of the outbreak.<ref name="nomadic tribe mystery illness"/><ref name="mystery disease"/> On 8 June, a further 83 villagers presented pneumonia with two of them, a 36-year-old woman and three-year-old baby, in critical condition.<ref name="mystery disease"/> Thirty-seven of the villagers received outpatient treatment with 32 treated at Gua Musang Hospital, 11 at Kuala Krai Hospital, and another three at the Orang Asli Health Homestay.<ref name="mystery disease"/> Another died on 16 June, bringing the total death toll to 15.<ref name="confirmed measles"/>

=== Villager claims ===
One of the villagers claimed that the deaths are caused by [[mining]] activity that is situated near the village. He revealed that his two daughters have been experiencing breathing difficulty for days and could not sleep at night; his neighbours also suffering from the same disease, some of which have died.<ref name="nomadic tribe mystery illness"/> Despite knowing the nearby mining activities causing pollution to their [[water resources|water source]], another villager claimed they have no other choice than to use the water for their daily activities.<ref name="mystery disease"/>

== Official response, investigation, and conclusion ==
On 9 June, the Malaysian [[Government of Malaysia|federal government]] through Deputy Prime Minister [[Wan Azizah Wan Ismail]] said they are investigating the cause as well the allegations of [[water pollution]] and promised stern action will be taken against the culprits if it is indeed found the deaths were caused by contamination on their water source.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/malaysia-investigate-water-pollution-orang-asli-deaths-dpm-11610072|title=Malaysia to investigate water pollution allegations after Orang Asli deaths in Kelantan: DPM|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=9 June 2019|access-date=27 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827033032/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/malaysia-investigate-water-pollution-orang-asli-deaths-dpm-11610072|archive-date=27 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A similar statement was echoed by Water, Land and Natural Resources Minister [[Tengku Zulpuri Shah Raja Puji]] during his visit to the affected community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/06/495115/pneumonia-outbreak-ministry-probing-claims-water-contamination|title=Pneumonia outbreak: Ministry probing claims of water contamination|work=Bernama|publisher=New Straits Times|date=10 June 2019|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref> On 11 June, Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah called an emergency meeting for the unexplained deaths which was attended by a minister in the Prime Minister's Department, [[Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy]], Health Minister [[Dzulkefly Ahmad]] and Energy, Technology, Science, Climatic Change and Environment Minister [[Yeo Bee Yin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/06/11/dr-wan-azizah-chairs-emergency-meeting-on-unexplained-orang-asli-deaths/1761160|title=Dr Wan Azizah chairs emergency meeting on 'unexplained' Orang Asli deaths|work=Bernama|publisher=The Malay Mail|date=11 June 2019|access-date=27 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827054410/https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/06/11/dr-wan-azizah-chairs-emergency-meeting-on-unexplained-orang-asli-deaths/1761160|archive-date=27 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Based on samples taken by the Environment Department from the [[manganese]] mine and [[water catchment]] areas close to the villagers settlement, the results on 12 June showed the water is free of hazardous contaminants and meet the standards for [[raw water]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/06/14/water-samples-near-kuala-koh-orang-asli-settlement-free-from-contaminants-says-doe|title=Water samples near Kuala Koh Orang Asli settlement free from contaminants, says DOE|author=Jo Timbuong|work=The Star|date=14 June 2019|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref> On the same day, the affected area was declared by [[Royal Malaysia Police|police]] as a "red zone".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/06/495736/orang-asli-deaths-kampung-kuala-koh-declared-red-zone|title=Orang Asli deaths: Kampung Kuala Koh declared 'red zone'|author=Sharifah Mahsinah Abdullah|publisher=New Straits Times|date=12 June 2019|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref> Through further laboratory tests on 37 villagers in the area with similar symptoms of illness, the disease was finally confirmed to be measles on 15 June.<ref name="confirmed measles"/><ref name="MOH confirmed measles"/> Until 20 June, a further 43 measles cases are confirmed among the community with three more respiratory illnesses also being reported in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=1737469|title=43 confirmed measles cases among Kuala Koh Batek tribesmen - MOH|publisher=Bernama|date=20 June 2019|access-date=27 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827033032/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/malaysia-investigate-water-pollution-orang-asli-deaths-dpm-11610072|archive-date=27 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/06/22/three-more-cases-of-respiratory-illness-reported-in-kuala-koh|title=Health Ministry: Three more cases of respiratory illness reported in Kg Kuala Koh|author=Tarrence Tan|work=The Star|date=22 June 2019|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref>

The Malaysian Health Ministry said the cause of the spread among the Orang Asli community is due to low coverage of [[MMR vaccine|MMR immunisation]] which is attributed to the relatively low [[immunisation]] rate among the community with their [[nomad|nomadic lifestyle]]. Health Minister [[Dzulkefly Ahmad]] explained that although 61.5% of the villagers received their first measles, [[mumps]], and [[rubella]] (MMR) shots, only 30% of them had their follow-up shots.<ref name="confirmed measles"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/06/17/health-minister-verifies-kuala-koh-orang-asli-hit-by-measles-outbreak/1762901|title=Health minister verifies Kuala Koh Orang Asli hit by measles outbreak|author=Debra Chong|publisher=The Malay Mail|date=17 June 2019|access-date=27 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827034447/https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/06/17/health-minister-verifies-kuala-koh-orang-asli-hit-by-measles-outbreak/1762901|archive-date=27 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the outbreak was announced, 113 cases has been reported in the affected area with a total 43 confirmed cases.<ref name="confirmed and suspected measles by gov"/> Despite the relatively low deaths reported by the findings of Health Ministry, the latter was unable to confirm the post-mortems results on the skeletal remains of several more victims.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/07/501996/kampung-kuala-koh-orang-asli-deaths-post-mortems-inconclusive|title=Kampung Kuala Koh Orang Asli deaths: post-mortems inconclusive|work=Bernama|publisher=New Straits Times|date=6 July 2019|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref> The "red zone" declaration was lifted on 8 July after the area was declared safe for the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/07/502320/kampung-kuala-koh-safe-authorities-lift-red-zone-order-tomorrow|title=Kampung Kuala Koh safe, authorities to lift 'red zone' order tomorrow|author=Sharifah Mahsinah Abdullah|publisher=New Straits Times|date=7 July 2019|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref>
