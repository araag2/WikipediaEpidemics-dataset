The '''2019 Samoa measles outbreak''' began in September 2019.<ref name=ministry/>  As of 6 January 2020, there were over 5,700 cases of [[measles]] and 83 deaths, out of a Samoan population of 200,874.<ref name="now 83"/><ref name="SBS_DEM"/> Over three percent of the population were infected.<ref name="NEOC_R36"/> The cause of the outbreak was attributed to decreased vaccination rates, from 74% in 2017 to 31–34% in 2018, even though nearby islands had rates near 99%.

A [[state of emergency]] was declared on 17 November, ordering the closure of all schools, keeping children under 17 away from public events, and vaccination became mandatory. On 2 December 2019, the government imposed a curfew and cancelled all Christmas celebrations and public gatherings. Families seeking [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] vaccination were asked by the government to display an item of red cloth in front of their homes so as to alert mobile medical teams traveling the island during the lockdown.<ref name="telegraph"></ref> Some added messages like "Help!" or "I want to live!".<ref name= "nyt"/> On 5 and 6 December, the government shut down everything to bring civil servants over to the vaccination campaign. This curfew was lifted on 7 December when the government estimated that the vaccination program had reached 90% of the population. On 14 December, the state of emergency was extended to 29 December.<ref name= "extended"/> Samoan anti-vaccination activist Edwin Tamasese was arrested and charged with "incitement against a government order". Finally, as of 22 December 2019, an estimated 94% of the eligible population had been vaccinated.<ref name= "NEOC_R36"/>

==Background==
[[File:Measles timeline exposure to illness.gif|left|thumb|Hypothetical measles timeline from exposure to illness]]

[[Measles]] first arrived in [[Samoa]] in 1893, carried by a steamer from New Zealand. By the end of 1893, over 1,000 people (of a total population of 34,500 at that time) had died from the disease.<ref name=old/>

In the early part of 2019, measles has been spreading throughout the Pacific region, with outbreaks in [[Tonga]], [[Fiji]], the [[Philippines]] and New Zealand.<ref name=" New sci"/>

In March 2019, the WHO and UN children's agency UNICEF warned the Pacific to take proactive measures and improve immunisation rates.<ref name="warning"/>

==2019 outbreak==
In August 2019, an infected passenger on one of the more than 8,000 annual flights between New Zealand and Samoa probably brought the disease from [[Auckland]] to [[Upolu]].<ref name="telegraph"/>  A full outbreak began in October 2019 and continued for the next four months. As of 22 December, there were 79 deaths (0.4 per 1,000, based on a population of 200,874,<ref name="NEOC_R36"/><ref name="SBS_DEM"/> a rate of 14.3 deaths per 1000 infected) and 5,520 cases (2.75% of the population) of measles in Samoa.<ref name="rw" /><ref name="NEOC_R36"/><ref name="SBS_DEM"/> 61 out of the first 70 deaths were aged four and under and all but seven were aged under 15.<ref name=NEOC_R23/><ref name=reuters/>

At least 20% of babies aged six to 11 months have contracted measles, and one in 150 babies have died.<ref name=HOW/>

As of 20 December 94% of the population had been vaccinated.<ref name="HOW" /><ref name="94i" /> 95% is required to acquire [[herd immunity]] for measles.<ref name="HOW" /> Measles is much more contagious compared to other infectious diseases such as polio, which only requires an 80% vaccination rate for the population to attain herd immunity.<ref name="herd" />

==Vaccine hesitancy==
The outbreak has been attributed to a sharp drop in [[measles vaccination]] from the previous year.<ref name="10 months"/>

In 2013, 90% of babies in Samoa received the [[MMR vaccine|measles-mumps-rubella vaccination]] at one year of age.<ref name="nyt"/>

On 6 July 2018 on the east coast of [[Savai'i]], two 12-month-old children died after receiving MMR vaccinations.<ref name= "telegraph"/> The cause of death was incorrect preparation of the vaccine by two nurses who mixed vaccine powder with expired anaesthetic instead of the appropriate diluent.<ref name=nurse/> These two deaths were picked up by anti-vaccine groups and used to incite fear towards vaccination on social media, causing the government to suspend its measles vaccination programme for ten months, despite advice from the WHO.<ref name= "TheGuardian"/><ref name=" 10 months"/> The incident caused many Samoan residents to lose trust in the healthcare system.<ref name="under 15"/>

After the outbreak started, anti-vaxxers credited the deaths to poverty and poor nutrition or even to the vaccine itself, but this has been discounted by the international emergency medical support that arrived in November and December.<ref name= "telegraph"/> There has been no evidence of acute malnutrition, clinical vitamin A deficiency or immune deficiency as claimed by various anti-vaxxers.<ref name="telegraph" />

[[UNICEF]] and the [[World Health Organization]] estimate that the measles vaccination rate in Samoa fell from 74% in 2017 to 34% in 2018,<ref name="New sci" /><ref name="WHO_statistics" /> similar to some of the poorest countries in Africa.<ref name="nyt" /> Ideally, countries should have immunisation levels above 90%. Prior to the outbreak, vaccination rates had dropped to 31% in Samoa, compared to 99% in nearby [[Nauru]], [[Niue]], [[Cook Islands]],<ref name="wrong" /> and American Samoa.<ref name="US Samoa" />

Before seeking proper medical treatment, some parents first took their children to 'traditional healers' who used machines purchased from Australia that are claimed to produce immune-protective water.<ref name="nyt" />

Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji have all declared states of emergency to tackle their 2019 measles outbreaks. The high mortality rate in Samoa is attributed to the country's low vaccination rate (31%). In Tonga and Fiji, the lack of fatalities is explained by far higher vaccination rates.<ref name="wrong" />

==Government response==
Initially, schools remained open after the outbreak was declared. The Samoan government initially did not accept humanitarian support.<ref name="10 months"/>

A [[state of emergency]] was declared on 17 November, ordering the closure of all schools, keeping children under 17 away from public events, and making vaccination mandatory.<ref name=emergency/> UNICEF has sent 110,500 vaccines to Samoa. Tonga and Fiji have also declared states of emergency.<ref name=bbc/> Tonga closed all schools for several days, while [[American Samoa]] required all travellers from Tonga and Samoa to present proof of vaccination.<ref name=deadly/> In Fiji, vaccines are being prioritised for young children and people travelling overseas.<ref name=authorities/>

On 2 December 2019, the government imposed a [[curfew]] and cancelled all Christmas celebrations and public gatherings.<ref name=children/><ref name=police/> All unvaccinated families were ordered to display a red flag or red cloth in front of their homes to warn others and to aid mass vaccination efforts.<ref name=red/> As part of aid efforts, the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] has transported medical supplies and equipment to Samoa. Also, New Zealand, Australian, British, [[French Polynesia]]n, and French medical teams have been assisting Samoan medical authorities.<ref name=NZDF/>

On 5 and 6 December, the government shut down everything other than public utilities to assign all available civil servants to the vaccination campaign efforts.<ref name=arrest/>

Edwin Tamasese, an [[anti-vaccination]] activist with no medical training who is also the chair of a coconut farmers’ collective,<ref name="telegraph"/> was charged with "incitement against a government order".<ref name=arrest/> He had posted online comments like “Enjoy your killing spree.”<ref name="telegraph"/> He encouraged people to refuse immunisation, as he believed the vaccine caused measles,<ref name=hack/> and even discouraged life-saving antibiotics.<ref name="telegraph"/>  Tamasese faces up to two years in prison.<ref name="telegraph"/>

The curfew was lifted on 7 December when the government estimated that 90% of the population had been reached by the vaccination program.<ref name=sat/> Parliament passed a bill on 19 December to make measles vaccinations mandatory in 2020.<ref name="78i"/>

Nevertheless, as of 29 December, a public inquiry into the government's role in suspending vaccinations had not been announced. Deputy director of health Gaualofa Matalavea Saaga stated, "Having our case blasted out to the world is the last thing we want."<ref name= "telegraph"/> Samoa's political opposition called for the health minister to be removed from his position.<ref name="telegraph"/>

On 31 December, [[Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi]], the [[Prime Minister of Samoa]], addressed the nation to ring in the New Year; the measles outbreak was a focus of his speech. He acknowledged the support of the Samoan [[diaspora]] and 49 medical teams from the following countries and organisations: Australia, China, France/French Polynesia, Fiji through [[UNFPA]], Israel, United States/Hawaii, Japan, [[Papua New Guinea]], New Zealand, [[Norway]], United Nations Agencies, United Kingdom and UK Save the Children, [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Kiribati]] through the Pacific Community, American Samoa, [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], Blacktown Doctors Medical Centre, and Samoan Doctors Worldwide.<ref name= "address"/>

==International response==
The low vaccination rate of Samoa came as a surprise to New Zealand's government.<ref name=" n612"/> The Samoa Observer reported that New Zealand's Minister for Pacific People, [[William Sio]], was"  'of the impression' that Samoa had high immunisation rates. So to learn they were in fact {{Sic|fatality|}} low was a shock."<ref name="n612"/>

Since the outbreak, several organisations and countries have responded:
* Australian Medical Assistance Teams (AUSMAT) sent a team of nurses, doctors, and public health experts as well as medical equipment and supplies to Samoa and left on 3 January 2020 after eight weeks in Samoa in one of its longest-ever missions.<ref name="Aus"/><ref name="ausmat"/>
* New Zealand sent three rotations of the New Zealand Medical Assistance Team (NZMAT) of doctors, nurses and logistics specialists who supported Leulumoega Hospital and Faleolo Clinic to the west of Apia for six weeks.  NZ also sent a team of nurse vaccinators, 3,000 vaccination doses and vaccine fridges to Samoa in mid-November,<ref name=NZ/> and a small number of Intensive Care Clinicians.  Residents of [[Rotorua, New Zealand]] sent two dozen infant-size coffins decorated with flowers and butterflies to Samoan families.<ref name="coffins"/> On 14 December 2019, New Zealand Foreign Minister [[Winston Peters]] announced $1 million in funds towards preventive efforts in the Pacific.<ref name="1m"/>
* The United Kingdom EMT sent two rotations of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, an anaesthetist, and an epidemiologist for four weeks of support from the end of November to December 2019.<ref name="UKRes"/>
* French Polynesia sent a team of paediatric nurses
* Israel sent Intensive Care teams to Samoa to help with relief efforts.<ref name="nz1"/>
* Hawaii sent a medical mission of 75 doctors and nurses for two days at the beginning of December to assist with the mass vaccination campaign.
* On 10 December, American Samoa declared a measles outbreak and closed public schools and park gatherings<ref name= "hawaii"/> and suspended all entry permits for those travelling through Samoa and Tonga to American Samoa.<ref name= "no entry"/>
* [[UNICEF]] has sent 200,000 vaccines to Samoa.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2019-12-05|title=UN team aids Samoa response to deadly measles epidemic|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/12/1052881|access-date=2021-04-21|website=UN News|language=en}}</ref>
* The UN [[World Health Organization]] deployed 128 medical teams to assist in vaccination efforts. The UN [[Central Emergency Response Fund]] (CERF) allocated $2.7 million to support the response in Samoa as well as [[Tonga]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=":0" />
* The [[World Bank]] gave a US$3.5 million grant to support the response to the outbreak and another US$9.3m grant over the next five years to improve the health system.<ref name="nz1"/>
* Israel sent a team of two paediatricians, six nurses and one physiotherapist trained in disaster medicine from the Israel Center for Disaster Medicine and Humanitarian Response.<ref name= "israel"/>

===Others===
As of 24 December, the following agencies had sent Emergency Medical Team personnel to assist with the outbreak:<ref name= "christmas"/>

== Aftermath ==
Tuilaepa said he would propose legislation that would penalise parents who refused to vaccinate their children.<ref name="funds" /> The Samoan government allocated US$2.5 million for relief work.<ref name="funds" />

Immunology experts are now questioning the role of social media, primarily Facebook, and how social media facilitated the spread of [[Vaccine hesitancy|vaccination hesitancy]] during the lethal outbreak. The Immunisation Advisory Centre in New Zealand sees the Samoan crisis as a sign that social media needs to deal with dangerous misinformation.<ref name= "facebook"/>

As of 25 January 2020, Tuilaepa has so far resisted calls for an inquiry.<ref name= "No action"/> Opposition MP Olo Fiti Va'ai continues to call for an inquiry and was "apologising on behalf of Parliament and telling the people of Samoa that the government had failed miserably."<ref name="Ola"/><ref name="10 months"/>

Following the ousting of the HRPP in the [[2021 Samoan general election]], new Health Minister [[Valasi Toogamaga Tafito]] announced he was considering establishing an inquiry into the epidemic.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.samoaobserver.ws/category/samoa/89588 |title=Government considers measles inquiry |publisher=Samoa Observer |author=Joyetter Feagaimaali'i |date=18 August 2021 |access-date=29 August 2021}}</ref>
