{{further|Pandemic H1N1/09 virus#Nomenclature}}

The [[World Health Organization]] uses the term "(H1N1) 2009 pandemic" when referring to the event, and officially adopted the name "A(H1N1)pdm09" for the virus in 2010, after the conclusion of the pandemic.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/terminology_ah1n1pdm09/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505042135/http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/terminology_ah1n1pdm09/en/|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 May 2012|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO)|access-date=31 March 2020|title=Standardization of terminology of the pandemic A(H1N1)2009 virus}}</ref>

Controversy arose early on regarding the wide assortment of terms used by journalists, academics,
and officials. Labels like "H1N1 flu", "Swine flu", "Mexican flu", and variations thereof were typical. Criticism centered on how these names may confuse or mislead the public. It was argued that the names were [[Jargon|overly technical]] (e.g. "H1N1"), incorrectly implying that the disease is caused by contact with [[pigs]] or pig products, or provoking stigmatization against certain communities (e.g. "Mexican"). Some academics of the time asserted there is nothing wrong with such names,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Lamballerie X, Gould EA | title = With reference to Mexican flu | journal = Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 203 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 21462392 | pmc = 4941550 | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-2659.2009.00097.x }}</ref> while research published years later (in 2013) concluded that Mexican Americans and Latino Americans had indeed been stigmatized due to the frequent use of term "Mexican flu" in the news media.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McCauley M, Minsky S, Viswanath K | title = The H1N1 pandemic: media frames, stigmatization and coping | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 13 | pages = 1116 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24299568 | pmc = 3907032 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-13-1116 }}</ref>

Official entities adopted terms with varying consistency over the course of the pandemic. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] used names like "novel influenza A (H1N1)" or "2009 H1N1 flu".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/guidance/cruiseships.htm|title=Interim Novel Influenza A (H1N1) Guidance for Cruise Ships |date=5 August 2009|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |access-date=30 September 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091001112752/http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/guidance/cruiseships.htm| archive-date= 1 October 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> The [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] used the term "Pig Flu" early on.

As terminology changed to deal with these and other such issues, further criticism was made that the situation was unnecessarily confusing. For example, the news department at the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' produced an article with the humorous title "Swine Flu Names Evolving Faster Than Swine Flu Itself".<ref>{{cite news|title=Swine Flu Names Evolving Faster Than Swine Flu Itself | vauthors = Enserink M |date=8 May 2009|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2009/05/swine-flu-names-evolving-faster-swine-flu-itself|publisher=[[Science (magazine)|Science]]}}</ref>

===Severe cases===

The [[World Health Organization]] reports that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset.

===Complications===

Most complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors. [[Pulmonary]] complications are common. Primary influenza [[pneumonia]] occurs most commonly in adults and may progress rapidly to acute lung injury requiring [[mechanical ventilation]]. Secondary [[bacterial pneumonia|bacterial infection]] is more common in children. ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', including methicillin-resistant strains, is an important cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia with a high mortality rate; ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' is the second most important cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia for children and primary for adults. [[Neuromuscular]] and [[cardiac]] complications are unusual but may occur.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothberg MB, Haessler SD | title = Complications of seasonal and pandemic influenza | journal = Critical Care Medicine | volume = 38 | issue = 4 Suppl | pages = e91–97 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 19935413 | doi = 10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181c92eeb | s2cid = 43882788 }}</ref>

A United Kingdom investigation of risk factors for hospitalisation and poor outcome with pandemic A/H1N1 influenza looked at 631 patients from 55 hospitals admitted with confirmed infection from May through September 2009. 13% were admitted to a high dependency or intensive care unit and 5% died; 36% were aged <16 years and 5% were aged ≥65 years. Non-white and pregnant patients were over-represented. 45% of patients had at least one underlying condition, mainly [[asthma]], and 13% received antiviral drugs before admission. Of 349 with documented chest x-rays on admission, 29% had evidence of [[pneumonia]], but bacterial co-infection was uncommon. Multivariate analyses showed that physician-recorded obesity on admission and pulmonary conditions other than asthma or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) were associated with a severe outcome, as were radiologically confirmed pneumonia and a raised [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) level (≥{{Nowrap|100 mg/l)}}. 59% of all in-hospital deaths occurred in previously healthy people.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen-Van-Tam JS, Openshaw PJ, Hashim A, Gadd EM, Lim WS, Semple MG, Read RC, Taylor BL, Brett SJ, McMenamin J, Enstone JE, Armstrong C, Nicholson KG | display-authors = 6 | title = Risk factors for hospitalisation and poor outcome with pandemic A/H1N1 influenza: United Kingdom first wave (May–September 2009) | journal = Thorax | volume = 65 | issue = 7 | pages = 645–51 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20627925 | pmc = 2921287 | doi = 10.1136/thx.2010.135210 }}</ref>

[[Fulminant]] (sudden-onset) [[myocarditis]] has been linked to infection with H1N1, with at least four cases of myocarditis confirmed in patients also infected with A/H1N1.

On 22 June 2010, the CDC announced a new test called the "CDC Influenza 2009 A (H1N1)pdm Real-Time RT-PCR Panel (IVD)". It uses a molecular biology technique to detect influenza A viruses and specifically the 2009 H1N1 virus. The new test will replace the previous real-time RT-PCR diagnostic test used during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which received an emergency use authorization from the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] in April 2009.

==Cause==

{{Main|Pandemic H1N1/09 virus}}

The virus was found to be a novel strain of influenza for which existing [[vaccination|vaccines]] against seasonal flu provided little protection. A study at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published in May 2009 found that children had no preexisting immunity to the new strain but that adults, particularly those older than 60, had some degree of [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. Children showed no [[Cross-reactivity|cross-reactive]] [[antibody]] reaction to the new strain, adults aged 18 to 60 had 6–9%, and older adults 33%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/may2109serum-jw.html |title=Some immunity to novel H1N1 flu found in seniors | vauthors = Schnirring L |date=21 May 2009 |publisher=Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy |access-date=26 September 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090923225423/http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/swineflu/news/may2109serum-jw.html| archive-date= 23 September 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="MMWR" /> While it has been thought that these findings suggest the partial immunity in older adults may be due to previous exposure to similar seasonal influenza viruses, a November 2009 study of a rural unvaccinated population in China found only a 0.3% cross-reactive antibody reaction to the H1N1 strain, suggesting that previous vaccinations for seasonal flu and not exposure may have resulted in the immunity found in the older U.S. population.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen H, Wang Y, Liu W, Zhang J, Dong B, Fan X, de Jong MD, Farrar J, Riley S, Smith GJ, Guan Y | display-authors = 6 | title = Serologic survey of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, Guangxi Province, China | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 1849–50 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19891883 | pmc = 2857250 | doi = 10.3201/eid1511.090868 }}</ref>

In June 2010, scientists from Hong Kong reported discovery of a new swine flu virus: a hybrid of the pandemic H1N1 virus and viruses previously found in pigs. It was the first report of a reassortment of the pandemic virus, which in humans had been slow to evolve. [[Nancy Cox (virologist)|Nancy Cox]], head of the influenza division at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has said, "This particular paper is extremely interesting because it demonstrates for the first time what we had worried about at the very onset of the pandemic, and that is that this particular virus, when introduced into pigs, could reassort with the resident viruses in pigs and we would have new gene constellations. And bingo, here we are." Pigs have been termed the mixing vessel of flu because they can be infected both by avian flu viruses, which rarely directly infect people, and by human viruses. When pigs become simultaneously infected with more than one virus, the viruses can swap genes, producing new variants which can pass to humans and sometimes spread amongst them.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vijaykrishna D, Poon LL, Zhu HC, Ma SK, Li OT, Cheung CL, Smith GJ, Peiris JS, Guan Y | display-authors = 6 | title = Reassortment of pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza A virus in swine | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5985 | pages = 1529 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20558710 | pmc = 3569847 | doi = 10.1126/science.1189132 | bibcode = 2010Sci...328.1529V }}</ref> "Unlike the situation with birds and humans, we have a situation with pigs and humans where there's a two-way street of exchange of viruses.

===Transmission===

Spread of the H1N1 virus is thought to occur in the same way that seasonal flu spreads. Flu viruses are spread mainly from person to person through coughing or sneezing by people with influenza. Sometimes people may become infected by touching something—such as a surface or object—with flu viruses on it and then touching their face.<ref name="fluandyou">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/H1N1flu/qa.htm|title=2009 H1N1 Flu ("Swine Flu") and You|date=10 February 2010|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |access-date=26 February 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100304031110/http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/qa.htm| archive-date= 4 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

===Vaccines===

{{Main|2009 swine flu pandemic vaccine}}
[[File:A nurse vaccinates Barack Obama against H1N1.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] being vaccinated against H1N1 flu on 20 December 2009]]

By 19 November 2009, doses of vaccine had been administered in over 16 countries. A 2009 review by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine has a safety profile similar to that of the seasonal vaccine.

In 2011, a study from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network estimated the overall effectiveness of all pandemic H1N1 vaccines at 56%. A CDC study released 28 January 2013, estimated that the Pandemic H1N1 vaccine saved roughly 300 lives and prevented about a million illnesses in the US. The study concluded that had the vaccination program started two weeks earlier, close to 60% more cases could have been prevented. The study was based on an effectiveness in preventing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths of 62% for all subgroups except people over 65, for whom the effectiveness was estimated at 43%. The effectiveness was based on European and Asian studies and expert opinion. The delay in vaccine administration demonstrated the shortcomings of the world's capacity for vaccine-production, as well as problems with international distribution. Some manufacturers and wealthy countries had concerns regarding liability and regulations, as well as the logistics of transporting, storing, and administering vaccines to be donated to poorer countries.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fineberg HV | title = Pandemic preparedness and response—lessons from the H1N1 influenza of 2009 | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 370 | issue = 14 | pages = 1335–42 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24693893 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1208802 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Accusations of conflict of interest===

In January 2010, [[Wolfgang Wodarg]], a German deputy who trained as a physician and chaired the health committee at the [[Council of Europe]], claimed that major firms had organized a "campaign of panic" to put pressure on the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) to declare a "false pandemic" to sell vaccines. Wodarg said the WHO's "false pandemic" flu campaign is "one of the greatest medicine scandals of the century". He said that the "false pandemic" campaign began in May 2009 in [[Mexico City]], when a hundred or so "normal" reported influenza cases were declared to be the beginning of a threatening new pandemic, although he said there was little scientific evidence for it. Nevertheless, he argued that the WHO, "in cooperation with some big pharmaceutical companies and their scientists, re-defined pandemics," removing the statement that "an enormous amount of people have contracted the illness or died" from its existing definition and replacing it by stating simply that there has to be a virus, spreading beyond borders and to which people have no immunity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/swine-flu/story-e6frfkyi-1225818388508|title=Swine flu 'a false pandemic' to sell vaccines, expert says|date=13 January 2010|publisher=[[News.com]]|access-date=13 January 2010 | vauthors = Pollard C | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100114013335/http://www.news.com.au/world/swine-flu/story-e6frfkyi-1225818388508| archive-date= 14 January 2010 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

The WHO responded by stating that they take their duty to provide independent advice seriously and guarded against interference from outside interests. Announcing a review of the WHO's actions, spokeswoman Fadela Chaib stated: "Criticism is part of an outbreak cycle. We expect and indeed welcome criticism and the chance to discuss it".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BL2ZT20100112 |work=Reuters |title=WHO to review its handling of H1N1 flu pandemic |date=12 January 2010 |access-date=14 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124224735/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BL2ZT20100112 |archive-date=24 November 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Bloomberg {{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&sid=ahj0H_RH8U68 |title=WHO to Clarify H1N1 Data After False Pandemic Claim (Update1) |access-date=21 August 2017 |publisher= Bloomberg |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307164337/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&sid=ahj0H_RH8U68 |archive-date=7 March 2010 }}</ref> The WHO also stated on their website that "The world is going through a real pandemic.

On 12 April 2010, Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's top influenza expert, stated that the system leading to the declaration of a pandemic led to confusion about H1N1 circulating around the world and he expressed concern that there was a failure to communicate in regard to uncertainties about the new virus, which turned out to be not as deadly as feared. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan appointed 29 flu experts from outside the organization to conduct a review of WHO's handling of the H1N1 flu pandemic. She told them, "We want a frank, critical, transparent, credible and independent review of our performance."<ref name=letter>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2010/letter_bmj_20100608/en/index.html |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |author=Chan M |date=8 June 2010 |title=WHO Director-General's letter to BMJ editors|access-date=30 January 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110130000141/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2010/letter_bmj_20100608/en/index.html| archive-date= 30 January 2011 | url-status= dead}}</ref>

In June 2010, [[Fiona Godlee]], editor-in-chief of the ''[[BMJ]]'', published an editorial which criticised the WHO, saying that an investigation had disclosed that some of the experts advising WHO on the pandemic had financial ties with drug companies which were producing antivirals and vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Godlee F | title = Conflicts of interest and pandemic flu | journal = BMJ | volume = 340 | pages = c2947 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20525680 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c2947 | s2cid = 323055 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2947.full#ref-1 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101221213507/http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2947.full | archive-date = 21 December 2010 }}</ref> Margaret Chan, Director-General of the WHO, replied stating, "Without question, the ''BMJ'' feature and editorial will leave many readers with the impression that WHO's decision to declare a pandemic was at least partially influenced by a desire to boost the profits of the pharmaceutical industry. The bottom line, however, is that decisions to raise the level of pandemic alert were based on clearly defined virological and epidemiological criteria. It is hard to bend these criteria, no matter what the motive".<ref name=letter/>

====Workplace====

Fearing a worst-case scenario, the U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) developed updated guidance<ref name="fluguidance"/> and a video for employers to use as they developed plans to respond to the H1N1 outbreak. The guidance suggested that employers consider and communicate their objectives, such as reducing transmission among staff, protecting people who are at increased risk of influenza-related complications from becoming infected, maintaining business operations, and minimising adverse effects on other entities in their [[supply chain]]s.<ref name="fluguidance">{{cite web|url=http://www.flu.gov/plan/workplaceplanning/guidance.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830005155/http://www.flu.gov/plan/workplaceplanning/guidance.html |archive-date= 30 August 2009 |title=Business Planning |work=Flu.gov |publisher=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services |access-date=17 September 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The CDC estimated that as much as 40% of the workforce might be unable to work at the peak of the pandemic due to the need for many healthy adults to stay home and care for an ill family member,<ref name="LATimes7-25">

The U.S. CDC did not recommend the use of face masks or [[respirator]]s in non-health care settings, such as schools, workplaces, or public places, with a few exceptions: people who were ill with the virus when around other people, and people who were at risk for severe illness while caring for someone with the flu.<ref name="cdcmasks">

====Pigs and food safety====

{{Main|2009 swine flu pandemic actions concerning pigs}}

The pandemic virus is a type of swine influenza, derived originally from a strain which lived in pigs, and this origin gave rise to the common name of "swine flu". This term is widely used by mass media, though the Paris-based [[World Organisation for Animal Health]] as well as industry groups such as the U.S. [[National Pork Board]], the [[American Meat Institute]], and the Canadian Pork Council objected to widespread media use of the name "swine flu" and suggested it should be called "North American flu" instead, while the World Health Organization switched its designation from "swine influenza" to "influenza A (H1N1)" in late April 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20090501-finally-flu-name-game-resolved-| vauthors = Leela J

To help avoid shortages of these drugs, the U.S. CDC recommended oseltamivir treatment primarily for people hospitalised with pandemic flu; people at risk of serious flu complications due to underlying medical conditions; and patients at risk of serious flu complications. The CDC warned that the indiscriminate use of antiviral medications to prevent and treat influenza could ease the way for [[drug-resistant]] strains to emerge, which would make the fight against the pandemic that much harder. In addition, a British report found that people often failed to complete a full course of the drug or took the medication when not needed.<ref name=Tami1>{{Cite news |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/economy/ap/53932902.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007164124/http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/economy/ap/53932902.html |archive-date=7 October 2009 |title=WHO: Healthy people who get swine flu don't need Tamiflu; drug for young, old, pregnant | vauthors = Cheng M |date=21 August 2009 |work=[[Washington Examiner]] |access-date=17 September 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Both medications mentioned above for treatment, oseltamivir and zanamivir, have known side effects, including lightheadedness, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and trouble breathing.

===Antivirals effectiveness questioned in healthy adults===

On 8 December 2009, the [[Cochrane Collaboration]], which reviews medical evidence, announced in a review published in ''[[BMJ]]'' that it had reversed its previous findings that the antiviral drugs [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu) and [[zanamivir]] (Relenza) can ward off [[pneumonia]] and other serious conditions linked to influenza. They reported that an analysis of 20 studies showed oseltamivir offered mild benefits for healthy adults if taken within 24 hours of onset of symptoms, but found no clear evidence it prevented lower respiratory tract infections or other [[complication (medicine)|complications]] of influenza.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&sid=a9acc7qIJFdU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107164229/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&sid=a9acc7qIJFdU|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 January 2010|title=Roche's Tamiflu Not Proven to Cut Flu Complications, Study Says| vauthors = Cortez MF |date=9 December 2009|publisher=Bloomberg L.P|access-date=11 December 2009}}</ref><ref name=BMJDec8>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jefferson T, Jones M, Doshi P, Del Mar C | title = Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in healthy adults: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = BMJ | volume = 339 | pages = b5106 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19995812 | pmc = 2790574 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.b5106 }}</ref> Of note, their published finding related only to use in healthy adults with influenza but not in patients judged to be at high risk of complications (pregnant women, children under five and those with underlying medical conditions), and uncertainty over its role in reducing complications in healthy adults still left it as a useful drug for reducing the duration of symptoms.

The initial outbreak received a week of near-constant media attention. [[Epidemiologist]]s cautioned that the number of cases reported in the early days of an outbreak can be very inaccurate and deceptive, due to several causes, among them [[selection bias]], [[media bias]] and incorrect reporting by governments. Inaccuracies could also be caused by authorities in different countries looking at differing population groups. Furthermore, countries with poor health care systems and older laboratory facilities may take longer to identify or report cases.<ref>{{Cite news |agency=[[Reuters]] |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/2687d9562c28b487c30aca4e889c5e93.htm |title= No A (H1N1) cases – reality or poor lab facilities? |date=8 May 2009 |access-date=9 May 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511130411/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/2687d9562c28b487c30aca4e889c5e93.htm| archive-date= 11 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> "[E]ven in developed countries the [numbers of flu deaths] are uncertain, because medical authorities don't usually verify who actually died of influenza and who died of a flu-like illness".<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Sandman P, Lanard J |year=2005|title=Bird Flu: Communicating the Risk|journal=Perspectives in Health Magazine|volume=10|issue=2|url=http://www.paho.org/English/DD/PIN/Number22_article1a.htm|access-date=14 April 2011 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423155359/http://www.paho.org/English/DD/PIN/Number22_article1a.htm|archive-date=23 April 2011}}</ref> Joseph S.

===Follow-up===

A Wisconsin study published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in September 2010, reported that findings showed that the 2009 H1N1 flu was no more severe than the seasonal flu. "The risk of most serious complications was not elevated in adults or children", the study's authors wrote. "Children were disproportionately affected by 2009 H1N1 infection, but the perceived severity of symptoms and risk of serious outcomes were not increased." Children infected in the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic were no more likely to be hospitalized with complications or get pneumonia than those who catch seasonal strains. About 1.5% of children with the H1N1 swine flu strain were hospitalized within 30 days, compared with 3.7% of those sick with a seasonal strain of H1N1 and 3.1% with an H3N2 virus.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Randall T |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-07/swine-flu-in-children-is-no-more-severe-than-seasonal-virus-study-finds.html |title=Swine Flu Found No More Severe Than Seasonal Virus |publisher=Bloomberg |date=7 September 2010 |access-date=24 May 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910101552/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-07/swine-flu-in-children-is-no-more-severe-than-seasonal-virus-study-finds.html |archive-date=10 September 2010 }}</ref>

CDC illness and death estimates from April 2009 to April 2010, in the US are as follows:
* between 43&nbsp;million and 89&nbsp;million cases of 2009 H1N1 occurred between April 2009 and 10 April 2010. The mid-level in this range is about 61&nbsp;million people infected with 2009 H1N1.
* between about 195,000 and 403,000 H1N1-related hospitalizations occurred between April 2009 and 10 April 2010. The mid-level in this range is about 274,000 2009 H1N1-related hospitalizations.
* between about 8,870 and 18,300 2009 H1N1-related deaths occurred between April 2009 and 10 April 2010.

It has been stated that about 36,000 die from the seasonal flu in the U.S. each year,<ref>{{cite news | vauthors = Mason M |url= http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html |title=Flu – Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment of Flu – NY Times Health Information |access-date=24 May 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714223418/http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/the-flu/overview.html |archive-date=14 July 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref> and this is frequently understood as an indication that the H1N1 strain was not as severe as seasonal influenza. The 36,000 estimate was presented in a 2003 study by CDC scientists and refers to a period from 1990 to 1991 through 1998–99. During those years, the number of estimated deaths ranged from 17,000 to 52,000, with an average of about 36,000. Throughout that decade, influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant virus during most of the seasons, and H3N2 influenza viruses are typically associated with higher death rates. The ''JAMA'' study also looked at seasonal influenza-associated deaths over a 23-year period, from 1976 to 1977 and 1998–99 with estimates of respiratory and circulatory influenza-associated deaths ranging from about 5,000 to about 52,000, and an average of about 25,000.

The 2009 pandemic caused US hospitals to make significant preparations in terms of hospital surge capacities, especially within the emergency department and among vulnerable populations. In many cases, hospitals were relatively successful in making sure that those patients most severely affected by the influenza strain were able to be seen, treated, and discharged in an efficient manner. A case-study of the preparation, planning, mitigation, and response efforts during the fall of 2009 is that of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) which took several steps to increase the emergency department (ED) surge capacity response. CHOP used portions of the main lobby area as an ED waiting room; several of the region's hospital-based outpatient facilities were in use during evening and weekend hours for non-emergency cases; the ED's 24-hour short-stay unit was utilized to care for ED patients in a longer-term capacity; non-board certified physicians (in pediatric emergency medicine) and inpatient-unit medical nurses were utilized for ED patient care; hospital units normally utilized for other medical or therapeutic purposes were transformed into ED patient rooms; and rooms normally used for only one patient were expanded to at least a capacity of 2.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scarfone RJ, Coffin S, Fieldston ES, Falkowski G, Cooney MG, Grenfell S | title = Hospital-based pandemic influenza preparedness and response: strategies to increase surge capacity | journal = Pediatric Emergency Care | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 565–72 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21642799 | doi = 10.1097/PEC.0b013e31821dc9d1 | s2cid = 11222604 }}</ref>

==Comparisons to other pandemics and epidemics==
Annual influenza epidemics are estimated to affect 5–15% of the global population.

In addition to these annual epidemics, Influenza A virus strains caused three global pandemics during the 20th century: the Spanish flu in 1918, [[1957–1958 influenza pandemic|Asian flu]] in 1957, and [[Hong Kong flu]] in 1968–69.

People who contracted influenza before 1957 appeared to have some immunity to H1N1 flu. According to Daniel Jernigan, head of flu epidemiology for the U.S. CDC "Tests on blood serum from older people showed that they had antibodies that attacked the new virus&nbsp;...

A WHO-supported 2013 study estimated that the 2009 global pandemic respiratory mortality was ~10-fold higher than the World Health Organization's laboratory-confirmed mortality count (18.631). Although the pandemic mortality estimate was similar in magnitude to that of seasonal influenza, a marked shift toward mortality among persons less than 65 years of age occurred, so that many more life-years were lost. Between 123,000 and 203,000 pandemic respiratory deaths were estimated globally for the last nine months of 2009. The majority (62–85%) were attributed to persons under 65 years of age. The burden varied greatly among countries. There was an almost 20-fold higher mortality in some countries in the Americas than in Europe. The model attributed 148,000–249,000 respiratory deaths to influenza in an average pre-pandemic season, with only 19% in persons <65 years of age.<ref name="mortality estimate worldwide">{{cite journal | vauthors = Simonsen L, Spreeuwenberg P, Lustig R, Taylor RJ, Fleming DM, Kroneman M, Van Kerkhove MD, Mounts AW, Paget WJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Global mortality estimates for the 2009 Influenza Pandemic from the GLaMOR project: a modeling study | journal = PLOS Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = e1001558 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24302890 | pmc = 3841239 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001558 }}</ref>
