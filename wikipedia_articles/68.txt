===2020 Équateur province===
On 1 June 2020, the Congolese health ministry announced a new DRC outbreak of Ebola in [[Mbandaka]], [[Équateur Province]], a region along the Congo River. This area was the site of the [[2018 Équateur province Ebola outbreak]], which infected 53 people and resulted in 29 deaths. That outbreak was quickly brought under control with the use of the Ebola vaccine.

Genome sequencing suggested that this 2020 outbreak, the 11th outbreak since the virus was first discovered in the country in 1976, was unrelated to the one in North Kivu Province or the previous outbreak in the same area in 2018.  It was reported that six cases had been identified with four fatalities. It was expected that more people would be identified as surveillance activities increased.<ref name="auto1"/>

The WHO assisted with the response to this outbreak in part using the structures put in place for the 2018 outbreak. Testing and contact tracing was used and additional medical staff had been sent in.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Ebola outbreak detected in northwest Democratic Republic of the Congo; WHO surge team supporting the response |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/01-06-2020-new-ebola-outbreak-detected-in-northwest-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-who-surge-team-supporting-the-response#:~:text=New%20Ebola%20outbreak%20detected%20in%20northwest%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the,surge%20team%20supporting%20the%20response&text=The%20Government%20of%20the%20Democratic,%2C%20Mbandaka%2C%20in%20%C3%89quateur%20province. |website=World Health Organization |access-date=7 June 2020}}</ref> [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] was also on hand to give assistance if needed. The outbreak added to an already difficult time for the Congo due to both [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] cases and a [[2019–2020 measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|large measles outbreak]] that has caused more than 7,000 deaths as of August 2020.<ref name="msf.org"/>

By 8 June, a total of 12 cases had been identified in and around Mbandaka and 6 deaths due to the virus. The WHO said 300 people in Mbandaka and the surrounding Équateur province had been vaccinated.<ref>{{cite web |title=Up to 12 Infected in Congo's New Ebola Outbreak: WHO |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-06-08/up-to-12-infected-in-congos-new-ebola-outbreak-who |website=USNews |publisher=USNews |access-date=8 June 2020}}</ref> By 15 June the case count had increased to 17 with 11 deaths, with more than 2,500 people having been vaccinated.<ref>{{cite web |title=17 infected, 11 dead in new Ebola outbreak in DR Congo |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/06/17-infected-11-dead-ebola-outbreak-dr-congo-200615112609457.html |website=www.aljazeera.com |access-date=15 June 2020}}</ref> On 17 October, it had increased to 128 cases and 53 deaths, despite an effective vaccine being available.<ref>{{cite web |title=DR Congo's latest Ebola outbreak 'under control' |url=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-10-dr-congo-latest-ebola-outbreak.html |website=medicalxpress.com |access-date=19 October 2020 |language=en}}</ref> As of 18 November, the World Health Organization has had no reported cases of Ebola in Équateur province for 42 days; therefore the outbreak is over.<ref name="2020over1"/> In the end there were 130 cases and 55 dead due to the virus.<ref name="2020over2"/>
