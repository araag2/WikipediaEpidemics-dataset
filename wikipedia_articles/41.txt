==Epidemiology==

The first cases of yellow fever occurred in early September, but the first blood samples for confirmation were not sent to the [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]] reference laboratory in Dakar, Senegal until 30 October. On 9 November, WHO Sudan reported 266 suspected cases and 85 deaths for a case fatality rate of 32%. Most cases were in Central Dafur state (51.5 percent, reported in March 2013), but the outbreak later expanded to the four other states of North Darfur (21 percent), West Darfur (17.4 percent) and South Darfur (9.5 percent), including refugee camps related to the ongoing [[war in Darfur]].<ref>{{cite web|title=PRO/EDR> Yellow fever - Africa (12): Sudan (Darfur) 2013-03-02 15:02:44 Archive Number: 20130302.1567578|url=http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=1567578}}</ref>  Laboratory confirmation of yellow fever came on 13 November.<ref>{{cite web|title=PRO/AH/EDR> Yellow fever - Africa (15): Sudan (Darfur) WHO 2012-11-13 18:01:32 Archive Number: 20121113.1407906|url=http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=1407906|access-date=28 June 2015|ref=Archive Number: 20121113.1407906}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Yellow Fever Outbreak in Sudan|url=http://www.healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/yellow-fever-outbreak-sudan-103112|access-date=28 June 2015|agency=The Disease Daily|publisher=HealthMap|date=31 Oct 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701003611/http://www.healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/yellow-fever-outbreak-sudan-103112|archive-date=1 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Most of the cases were among nomads, which contributed to the rapid spread.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sudan Begins Emergency Vaccinations to Fight Yellow Fever Outbreak|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/sudan_begins_emergency_vaccinations_to_fight_yellow_fever_outbreak/1560840.html|access-date=28 June 2015|agency=Voice of America|date=7 December 2012}}</ref>

According to newspaper reports, about 10 000 workers from the gold mines of Jebel Amer fled to Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, after more than 60 deaths in the gold mining area.

==Vaccination Campaign==
On 13 November, the government of Sudan requested help from the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) in starting a mass vaccination campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yellow fever in Sudan|url=https://www.who.int/csr/don/2012_11_13/en/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810103343/http://www.who.int/csr/don/2012_11_13/en/|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 10, 2014|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=28 June 2015}}</ref> Besides the WHO, the YF-ICG consists of representatives of the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), [[Médecins sans Frontières]] (MSF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The [[United Nations–African Union Mission in Darfur]] (UNAMID) airlifted the first batches of vaccines from Khartoum to Darfur on 18 November.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sudan: Unamid Lends Resources to Fighting Yellow Fever in Darfur|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201212020261.html|access-date=28 June 2015|publisher=AllAfrica|date=2 December 2012}}</ref> Mass vaccination began on 20 November.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sudan Combats Darfur Outbreak|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/world/africa/sudan-combats-yellow-fever-outbreak-in-darfur.html?_r=0|access-date=28 June 2015|work=New York Times|date=20 November 2012}}</ref> Efforts were also undertaken to eliminate mosquitoes.  A team from the [[Naval Medical Research Unit Three]] (NAMRU-3) and the WHO Collaborating Center was deployed from Cairo to help collect and test samples and train local personnel. The vaccination campaign, from late November 2012 through early January 2013, covered more than 3 million people and halted the outbreak. A new phase of the campaign beginning in January covered more than 2 million more people at risk.<ref>{{cite web|title=PRO/AH/EDR> Yellow fever - Africa (06): Sudan (Darfur) 2013-01-25 10:43:16 Archive Number: 20130125.1513849|url=http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=1513849|website=Pro-MED-mail|publisher=International Society for Infectious Diseases}}</ref> One of the difficulties was maintaining a [[cold chain]] for vaccine viability while transporting vaccine by donkey into remote areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=PRO/AH/EDR> Yellow fever - Africa (35): Sudan (Darfur) 2012-12-08 20:46:04 Archive Number: 20121208.1443535|url=http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=1443535|publisher=International Society for Infectious Diseases}}</ref>
