An [[epidemic]] of [[Zika fever]], caused by [[Zika virus]], began in [[Brazil]] and affected other countries in the Americas  from April 2015 to November 2016. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) declared the end of the epidemic in November 2016, but noted that the virus still represents "a highly significant and long term problem".<ref name="WHO: Zika Virus No Longer International Emergency But Still a Threat">{{cite news |url=https://newsline.com/zika-virus-no-longer-international-emergency-still-threat/ |title=WHO: Zika Virus No Longer International Emergency But Still a Threat |work=Newsline |date=November 21, 2016 |access-date=November 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211072422/https://newsline.com/zika-virus-no-longer-international-emergency-still-threat/ |archive-date=February 11, 2018 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  It is estimated that 1.5 million people were infected by Zika virus in Brazil,<ref name="Reuters18Feb2016">{{cite news |first1=Anthony |first2=Tom |last1=Boadle |last2=Brown |last3=Orr |first3=Bernard | name-list-style = vanc |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-brazil-idUSKCN0VR2P8 |title=U.S., Brazil researchers join forces to battle Zika virus |work=[[Reuters]] |date=18 February 2016 |access-date=4 March 2016 |location=Brasilia}}</ref> with over 3,500&nbsp;cases of infant [[microcephaly]] reported between October&nbsp;2015 and January&nbsp;2016.<ref name="ECDC25Nov2015">{{cite web |url= http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?ID=1329&List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&Source=http%3A%2F%2Fecdc.europa.eu%2Fen%2FPages%2Fhome.aspx |title=Microcephaly in Brazil potentially linked to the Zika virus epidemic, ECDC assesses the risk |work=News and Media |publisher=[[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control]] |date=25 November 2015 |access-date=18 January 2016}}</ref> The epidemic also affected other parts of [[South America|South]] and [[North America]], as well as several islands in the Pacific.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthmap.org/zika/|title=Zika Map - Virus & Contagious Disease Surveillance|publisher=HealthMap|access-date=August 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821164455/http://www.healthmap.org/zika/|archive-date=August 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Zika virus spread to Brazil from Oceania in 2013 or 2014. Brazil notified the WHO of an illness characterized by skin rash in March 2015, and Zika was identified as the cause in May 2015.

RT-PCR testing of serum and tissue samples can be used to detect the presence of the Zika virus. However, the RT-PCR test with serum is only helpful while the virus is still in the blood which is generally within the first week of the illness. After this period other methods should be used to determine if the virus is still present in the body. A test for IgM antibodies has seen to be effective over longer periods of time, as these antibodies can be present starting 4 days after the beginning of the illness and up to 12 weeks after that. However, it is suggested that a PRINT test be performed following a test for IgM antibodies to help eliminate false positives resulting from other flaviviruses. The PRINT test looks for viral-specific neutralizing antibodies. However, this test can still produce false positive results, for Zika, in individuals who have received immunization for or had previously been exposed to other flaviviruses.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2016-0621 |pmid=27009036 |title=Zika Virus Disease: A CDC Update for Pediatric Health Care Providers |journal=Pediatrics |volume=137 |issue=5 |pages=e20160621 |year=2016 |last1=Karwowski |first1=M.

To prevent the transmission of the Zika virus, WHO recommends using [[insect repellent]], wearing long-sleeved clothes to cover the body, and using screens and [[mosquito net]]s to exclude flying insects from dwellings or sleeping areas. It is also vital to eliminate any standing water near homes to minimize breeding areas for mosquitoes. Authorities can treat larger water containers with recommended [[larvicide]]s.<ref name="WHO Zika virus fact sheet" /><ref name="WHOPES-recommended compounds">{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/whopes/Mosquito_Larvicides_25_Oct_2013.pdf |title=WHOPES-recommended compounds and formulations for control of mosquito larvae |publisher=World Health Organization |date=October 25, 2013 |access-date=February 15, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203180043/http://www.who.int/whopes/Mosquito_Larvicides_25_Oct_2013.pdf |archive-date=December 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Furthermore, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommends that containers holding water near homes either be sealed or scrubbed once per week, because mosquito eggs can stick to them.<ref name="CDC Help Control Mosquitoes" />

== Prevention and treatment ==
While there are no known cures for Zika, there have been recent developments in Zika vaccination. Three vaccine designs are showing high confidence levels of protection against the Zika virus. Scientists have conducted tests on the rhesus monkey, and human trials began in late 2016.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamzelou|first1=Jessica|title=Zika vaccine trials begin – but fears remain over virus's impact|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2104167-zika-vaccine-trials-begin-but-fears-remain-over-viruss-impact/|website=New Scientist|access-date=12 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012160457/https://www.newscientist.com/article/2104167-zika-vaccine-trials-begin-but-fears-remain-over-viruss-impact/|archive-date=October 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

This preventative treatment is promising, but it will take years before it is available for widespread usage.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bednarczyk|first1=Robert|title=Why a Zika vaccine is a long way off|url=http://theconversation.com/why-a-zika-vaccine-is-a-long-way-off-63804|website=the conversation|access-date=12 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012153829/http://theconversation.com/why-a-zika-vaccine-is-a-long-way-off-63804|archive-date=October 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

British experts are clear that any of the vaccines would take considerable time to develop. Dr Ed Wright, a senior lecturer and virologist at the University of Westminster, said: "All of the vaccines currently under development are many years away from being licensed and available for widespread public use." Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said: "We knew that these vaccines worked in mice and now the researchers have shown that they also protect non-human primates from Zika virus infection." "The next step will be to see if these vaccines are safe and the scientists hope to start early trials in humans to address this."<ref name="ZikaEarlyPromise">{{cite news|access-date=August 8, 2016|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-36975088|title=Zika vaccines show early promise|work=BBC News|date=August 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808141125/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36975088|archive-date=August 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Kineta, a Seattle-based biotech company, is actively working on treatments and has received an undisclosed amount of funding from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, one of the National Institutes of Health, to carry on the research.

As of July 26, 2016, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. dosed the first subject in its multi-center phase I trial to evaluate Inovio's Zika DNA vaccine (GLS-5700). In addition to the previously announced US FDA approval for the conduct of the study, Health Canada's Health Products and Food Branch has also approved this study, which will be conducted at clinical sites in Miami, Philadelphia, and Quebec City. The phase I, open-label, dose-ranging study of 40 healthy adult volunteers is evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of GLS-5700 administered with the CELLECTRA®-3P device, Inovio's proprietary intradermal DNA delivery device. In preclinical testing, this synthetic vaccine induced robust antibody and T cell responses – the immune responses necessary to fight viral infections – in small and large animal models.<ref name = "InovioTrials">{{cite news| access-date=August 8, 2016| url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/07/26/858976/0/en/Inovio-Pharmaceuticals-Doses-First-Subject-in-Zika-Vaccine-Clinical-Trial.html| title=Inovio Pharmaceuticals Doses First Subject in Zika Vaccine Clinical Trial| work=Inovio Pharmaceuticals| date=July 26, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730213134/https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/07/26/858976/0/en/Inovio-Pharmaceuticals-Doses-First-Subject-in-Zika-Vaccine-Clinical-Trial.html| archive-date=July 30, 2016| url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Direct Relief]], an emergency response organization, established a Zika Fund and fulfilled requests for supplies in 14 affected countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.directrelief.org/emergency/zika-virus-outbreak/|title=Zika Virus Outbreak|date=2019-01-10|website=Direct Relief|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509145712/https://www.directrelief.org/emergency/zika-virus-outbreak/|archive-date=May 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Challenges to US response ==
In May 2017, the [[Government Accountability Office]] published a report, "Emerging Infectious Diseases: Actions Needed to Address the Challenges of Responding to Zika Virus Disease Outbreak", to correspond with an associated House subcommittee hearing. The GAO said that even though scientific breakthroughs have increased in recent years, the United States remains unprepared to handle a Zika virus outbreak.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/featured/22565-challenges-hobble-u-s-public-health-response-zika-virus/|title=Challenges hobble U.S. public health response to Zika virus|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2017-05-24|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203034610/https://homelandprepnews.com/featured/22565-challenges-hobble-u-s-public-health-response-zika-virus/|archive-date=February 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Timothy Persons, head scientist at the GAO, listed areas of limited research that damage the United States’ ability to effectively respond to a Zika outbreak, including an accurate record of the number of cases in the United States, components associated with transmission from mothers to children (especially regarding pregnancy), risk of transmission through bodily fluid as related to the potential for [[Transmission (medicine)|sexual transmission]] of the virus, impact of prior exposure to Zika and other [[arbovirus]]es, and both short-term and long-term outcomes. Recent outbreaks have been connected to an alarming a spike in [[microcephaly]], a birth defect that inhibits the proper development of a baby's brain, and [[Guillain–Barré syndrome|Guillain-Barré syndrome]], which causes paralysis.<ref name=":0" />

Other challenges include the lack of a safe and effective vaccine, a complicated diagnostic process, and faltering support for research funding in the federal government. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID), said "There aren’t any federally licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics currently available to prevent or treat Zika." Zika is often difficult to distinguish from other illnesses that are spread by mosquitoes, like [[Dengue fever|dengue]], [[West Nile fever|West Nile]], and [[chikungunya]], among others. President Trump's budget proposal for 2018 proposed stripping $800 billion from Medicaid over ten years. Democratic Representative [[Frank Pallone]] of New Jersey said that this decision "endangers our ability to manage public health emergencies like Zika."<ref name=":0" />

== Controversies ==
Some efforts to contain the spread of Zika virus have been controversial. Oxitec, the company behind the "self-limiting" mosquitoes, which pass on a fatal gene to their offspring, released in Brazil, has faced criticism from environmental groups, who fear that releasing a new mosquito strain into the wild will damage the ecosystem. In the short term, the concern is that a drop in the mosquito population could affect the populations of other species. Supporters claim that the environmental impact of the "self-limiting" mosquitoes will be minimal, since only one species of mosquito is being targeted and the genetically-modified mosquitoes are still safe for predators to eat. Oxitec Product Development Manager Derric Nimmo likened the process to "going in with a scalpel and taking away ''Aedes aegypti'', leaving everything untouched."<ref name="washingtonpostSelfDestruct">{{cite news | access-date=March 20, 2016 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/01/29/heres-how-gm-mosquitos-with-self-destruct-genes-could-save-us-from-zika-virus/ | title=How mosquitoes with 'self-destruct' genes could save us from Zika virus | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=January 29, 2016 | last=Kim | first=Meeri | issn=0190-8286 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319164356/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/01/29/heres-how-gm-mosquitos-with-self-destruct-genes-could-save-us-from-zika-virus/ | archive-date=March 19, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> Since ''Aedes aegypti'' is an imported [[invasive species]] in Brazil, some experts expect that its eradication will have little impact on the environment.

== Scientific communication and concerns ==
The 2015–2016 Zika virus outbreak became an important topic on many social media sites, especially on Twitter. An analysis of Twitter posts on February 2, 2016 showed that 50 tweets per minute were posted about Zika, many of which contained the hashtags #salud, which means health in Spanish as well as #who, which served as a reference to the World Health Organization.<ref name=":02">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-socialmedia/zika-virus-a-trending-topic-on-social-media-platforms-idUSKCN0VC2I0|title=Zika virus a trending topic on social media platforms|date=2016-02-03|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211054906/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-socialmedia/zika-virus-a-trending-topic-on-social-media-platforms-idUSKCN0VC2I0|archive-date=December 11, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The epidemic also caused a rise in tweets from college students upset that their spring break trips and study abroad plans had been changed or cancelled due to the virus’ spread.<ref name=":02" />

Many studies have been conducted on the connections and impact of social media mentions of Zika. One analysis found that the primary topics discussed on Twitter before the peak of the outbreak regarding Zika included Zika's impact, reactions to Zika, pregnancy and microcephaly, transmission routes of Zika, and case reports.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0894439317721985 |title=Crisis Communications in the Age of Social Media |journal=Social Science Computer Review |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=523–541 |year=2017 |last1=Hagen |first1=Loni |last2=Keller |first2=Thomas |last3=Neely |first3=Stephen |last4=Depaula |first4=Nic |last5=Robert-Cooperman |first5=Claudia |s2cid=67362137 }}</ref> During the summer of 2016 when Zika was spreading at a much faster rate, this social media analysis determined that the major topics on Twitter regarding Zika had become concerns about the spread of Zika, criticism of Congress, news about Zika, and scientific information about Zika.<ref name=":1" /> The same study also found that tweets from reputable institutions and people holding scientific credentials demonstrated the ability of Twitter as a source to spread information quickly on the internet.<ref name=":1" /> Another study found that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the general public showed similar concerns about Zika. The CDC's posts on Twitter during the outbreak focused on symptoms and education for Zika.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2016.08.019 |pmid=27751615 |title=Zika live Twitter chat |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |volume=44 |issue=12 |pages=1756–1757 |year=2016 |last1=Joob |first1=Beuy |last2=Wiwanitkit |first2=Viroj }}</ref> However, the public had more of a tendency to focus concern on the consequences of Zika on women and infants, such as microcephaly.<ref name=":2" />

While there was concern for children on social media, this concern was lacking in countries largely impacted by Zika virus, such as Brazil. In Brazil, struggling mothers of infants with microcephaly caused by Zika have used support systems on social media on the cellphone chat app called [[WhatsApp|Whatsapp]] or on [[Facebook]] pages that can help connect mothers in need of supplies and money to donors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/world/wp/2016/03/09/brazilmothers/|title=Poor Brazilian mothers join hands, turn to social media amid microcephaly crisis|last=Phillips|first=Dom|date=2016-03-09|newspaper=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211054825/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/world/wp/2016/03/09/brazilmothers/|archive-date=December 11, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The heavy traditional news and social media coverage of the virus spreading did cause concern over lack of reliability. Research has found that between May and June 2016, four out of five social media posts about Zika provided accurate information, but inaccurate posts were much more popular. This led many researchers to worry about the quality of information being spread and shared on social media.<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/zika-virus-outbreak/study-finds-people-wrong-stuff-social-media-better-n677356|title=If you're reading this, you might not like it.

However, misinformation is common and data control in the cyber world has become a growing necessity.<ref name=":2" />

Many people criticized the lack of governmental response from the U.S. Government in the wake of the crisis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/us-response-to-zika-fragmented-and-uneven-64039|title=US response to Zika: Fragmented and uneven|last=Greer|first=Scott L.|work=The Conversation|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210232542/https://theconversation.com/us-response-to-zika-fragmented-and-uneven-64039|archive-date=December 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The United States was criticized for a lack of preparedness in terms of an ability to contain a virus outbreak in the United States.
